1,"here are my top 8 things I own and love and swear by at uni girl. anything they have heat tuck. don't realize how good this is when you don't have it and it's cold. if you're in a cold place, please try a heat tuck item. I think these bags may have gone viral, but for a good reason. it's light, spacious, reasonable, and easy to style. the unikuro light down jackets are amazing and it fits in these little bags. I have 3 colors of these of fuzzy jackets. they're so soft. this is what I wore my entire trip in Japan. the black one to be exact. dress it up or down, super warm. I'm a blazer girly and I love unikuro blazers. they're reasonable and structured. I also have like 3 colors of this slip dress and anything airism. t shirts, leggings. it breathes amazingly as a little bonus. I love this unikuro technology. you put it in it immediately recognize what you have and you can check out."

0,What I wore to uni for my last week of classes
1,"Let's check out the fall launch at Uniqlo. We were invited to get a sneak peek of some of the new items. Definitely seeing a lot of vibrant colors, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see so many new styles and colors for men's stuff. I feel like it's really hard to shop for men because there's just not that many options, but I really like all of these jackets from Uniqlo. I'm definitely getting one for Cliff. For women, there's definitely an emphasis on comfort because there are so many cozy materials. They also introduced a super light Heattech, which is even thinner than their regular Heattech, meant for layering. I'm also definitely eyeing their outerwear, like this white wool coat and as well as their puffer jacket, which now comes in a new nano design which makes them super lightweight."
0,"Can you custom your own t-shirt? Hi guys, so this time I'm walking to Uniqlo to accompany my friend. I want to buy t-shirts, but you can custom them here. You can directly draw on the spot or you can also send your own design. In addition to t-shirts, tote bags can also be custom. While waiting for my friend to cross out,. I went around and I found this kind of clava reinforcements, besides the discount anyway. It was really funny but when I tried it like Anjay frog there was zip up,. Marnie hoodie was also nice, but not discounted. Skip first, there is a pure cardigan too. But I think it's too cake for the cave. Well actually this is what I'm looking for only the color is dusty pink. What I want is the gray color if used is good. So he was like a tashirt, just folded on top. This is the next time I find Guruka Shorts. This is the first time I found a uniqlo item that is not basic. This is the long version. If this one is good, but not used in Jakarta. Finally I decided to buy Marni chants. And it turned out that when I tried the fit it was steady too. Long story short because it was too late it turned out that the t-shirt could not be directly so today as well. I don't want to come here again tomorrow. Drunk? Drunk."
1,"I have a meeting with one of my favorite brands this morning, so we need to pick an outfit. It's Uniqlo. It's a little bit cooler today, so I'm going for these linen trousers from Uniqlo. I love these. Super comfortable, also super lightweight. Add a bit of contrast. I'm gonna go for this Uniqlo tea. This is part of their aerism collection, so it's great for, like, hot weather and stuff like that. Black and white cream combo is always a good idea. And I love how this tea sits. I like the long length of the sleeves. It's very cool. A little bit different from your average T-shirt. I'm then gonna add my Adia Specielles just to tighten the black, so it all looks like a nice outfit. Sandwich. The perfume,. I'm gonna go for this coach one again. I never remember what this one's called. Story. Again, today is Missouri. Since we're going with the Uniqlo theme,. I'm just gonna add this Uniqlo bag for a little bit of a cool vibe. Forever and always my favourite sunnies. And that is the fit for today. I'm off to a meeting. I will see you all tomorrow. Bye."
1,Unicorn Fossil just arrived which is very exciting because I basically did a little order of like capsule classics for summer and also for all year around all seasons but I'm gonna style them up for summer and hopefully they fit. I haven't actually tried anything on yet so hopefully they work hopefully I can style them different ways that I kind of envisioned in my head when I did this order but let's get styling and it trying on and then you guys can let me know your thoughts first up these little elasticated waist like boxer styled shorts so these are definitely a love it or hate it kind of thing because I actually think they might b boy boxes. I don't know like when I ordered them online they were I thought in the women's section but they were recommended and I was like. I've been on the hunt for a pair of shorts like this for so long to style with like blazers and little vests and then of colour trainers and bags particularly like how I'm styling now for like city days out where I wanna be really comfortable and I'm just going for like coffee catch UPS with my girls and it's really warm and I want to feel like put together but also just want to be really really comfortable and I feel like this is how I would style it at the moment. I also do really want a white pair of these but they were like completely be sold out overall really stretchy really comfortable not see through like at all and I feel like. I'm gonna wear these lots of different ways then I got a few errors and tops so these are like naturally oversized and went for an extra small of them and I feel like they have the perfect fit. I'll show you like untucked in a sec as well but then I got these trousers. I cannot remember for the life of me the name of them. I think they're called like tailored cotton trousers maybe and I was very unsure about sizing of these of what they'd be like on me but this is the extra small and oh my God they fit like a dream. I'm gonna have to get them in all like every color like what the length of. I'm 5 foot 3 and no trousers ever fit me like lengthwise and the fit around my waist as well it's just so perfect and really soft and comfortable these might be some of the best tether trousers I've ever tried on and the fact that I don't have to get them taken in like game changing this is the top so Jamie my boyfriend has like all the men's versions of these and I was like. I don't know why I've never tried the women's set of these. I really like the shape. I like the long sleeves they feel like really really amazing quality and I got a few other colours so let's try this on and this is the white tea so again just exactly the same went for an extra small and I just started with the trousers little bag and my dad's sandals for like a city day out but the tea. I just really love the shape of. I'd also maybe just wear it like that. I'm obsessed next up I got the tea in this like peachy color which I actually thought was gonna wash me out but I think cause I fake tanned it's quite nice and I saw that these linen trousers were like trending last week and I have wanted a pair that fit me lengthwise and again I read that they do fit very well on like if you're 5 foot 4 and under and guys what this is the best order I've ever done like everything fits like I swear when usually I order from somewhere nothing fits and it's all a little bit hit and miss but the fit of these. I went for extra small again in them fit true to size. I feel really beautiful on they're like a linen blend thinking of styling with this bag and then my Ray Bans and dad sandals like a city day out kind of outfit these come in multiple colors as well so do all the T's. I'm gonna leave everything linked to my bio but I'm gonna have to go and buy now different colors potentially because the T's are so amazing let me know which look was your favorite and I will see you guys soon lots of love mwah bye

1,since the fit was a little bit too wide for me some first impressions of the pants hello hello welcome to my channel so I made sure to kind of like cinch the crotch area so I had to go get them tailored at the local alterations location you know upscale for work. I think the tag said that it was a mixed polyester and rayon recently for Valentine's Day if you like the content anyone who's looking for a casual fit or something for a little bit thank you Kim. I would definitely say that these pants are great for you know so I'm giving a quick review of the uniqlo pants that my girlfriend got me and make the length a little bit shorter and make the tubes a little bit smaller the fabric was really soft so there was a good bit of weight to it they're really versatile for me definitely they were really high quality and here's a little bit of me wearing the pants when it was at the tailor. I think they're a little bit too big for me when I first got them see it was a little too long alright bye a little caveat with the pants subscribe for more
0,"Right, so I did it. I was. I have been influenced, but I think this is a good influence, cause it's not like this is something that's gonna, like, fade out. I don't think. I bought the Uniqlo bag and like,. I was a little bit annoyed, but I just posted you guys like 4 from you so that's the object anyway. I want to see how much I can fit in it. I'm gonna use books and measure how many books I can fit in there so. I have bookshelf here. I'm gonna go through a few little books that I've read you can heal your life sorry it's backwards I need to read that again. I saw a video of a girl putting a whole champagne bottle in and I got the wrong one because we got one book let's go Atomic Habit Atomic Habit start looking good guys. I think that's it. I mean I suppose the videos that people are doing they're like putting little things in there maybe books isn't a good way to measure who's walking around with loads of books but oh my god right random things I'm finding in my dad's office a bag of unopened marbles my microphone. I hope this is not on I was not on its enclosure okay maybe a little we can do a little book actually I want. I love this book this is called The Power of now and I even saved some pages want To be able to fit my Kindle in there. Right. Okay. I don't have anything else to fit in there, but maybe this is a really rubbish for you. Sorry. Uniqlo. I do think it's a good bag. It doesn't fit more than 2 books in there. So it needs to walk around with 2 books. Not me. Why was this. Sorry. Maybe I'll do a better video when I actually fill it with stuff that I actually. I'm gonna take out with me. But I got it in black, and now I want it in all of the colors."
1,"Hey, guys, let's go shopping for my birthday. I'm going to Uniqlo. Uniqlo is my favorite place because the Equality is so, so good, and the designs are minimal. I feel so comfortable wearing them. I normally buy dressed only for special occasions because I hate to do shopping. It's so confusing and I want everything in every color. And it's so hard to decide. Today I already choose 3 dress. So let's try. So before we try, we need to put this fabric back so our makeup won't spoil the dress. And first option, it's this skirt. It fits so well, and it got pockets to get along with it. I found some cute crop tops. My sister told me to try something girly this time, so I'm just going for skirts and gum. Second option is discount. I know it's same color, but it's super comfy and also got pockets. Last option. This turquoise. I love everything. I love all 3. I'm so confused. Okay, anyway. And this is the discount basket. And sometime you can find really good stuff with cheap rice. Okay, it's time to check out. We just have to put our dress in the box and it will automatically calculate the price. I really love the process. I was so tired shopping, so I need a tea break. And I decided to go to my favorite Bur Misty shop. They've got the best Cylon tea. Okay, that's all. Thanks for watching. Bye. Bye."

1,"How to get that Uniqlo aesthetic 1:01. Hey, friends, it's Ivy here, and if you didn't already know,. I freaking love Uniqlo. I just have the best basics like this erism T. And I'm not really a jeans girly much these days. I like wearing trousers. These are not from Uniqlo, but I'm pretty sure they have something very similar to this. Stealing this corduroy button down from my husband because he's just as obsessed with Uniqlo as I am. I swear, his whole wardrobe is literally Uniqlo. It's a little bit big on me, so I roll it up, of course. I really like this. Gives that Uniqlo kind of vibe. Yet I spend the next 10 minutes or so tucking in my shirt, judging it out. Got my AirPods from this cool girl. Effortless aesthetic in a tote bag, of course. Wish they had that tote bag making thing in Australia here in Uniqlo, but they don't. Here's the final look. Let me know if you want me to do another."
1,"hey, friends. so I love Uniqlo. like, I really, really love Uniqlo. and I've built quite a wardrobe from it. so I thought I would do my top 5 finds that every girl should have from Uniqlo winter edition. I firstly have this thermal top. it is the 29 91 I have about 6 of these here is another must have find this is a thermal turtleneck. it is 19 90 each. I have this in about 3 different colors. it is again the perfect layering piece. the 3rd piece I have are these thermal fluffy tights. these are just all thermals right now. these pieces fit so perfectly underneath a pair of jeans. no strong cold night wind can cut through these jeans. the 4th one that I have is this puffer. this is actually my husband's one and it is quite a bit more on the expensive side. but I genuinely think that it is such a great fit and the right amount of puffiness and warmth. I just realized I did 4 pieces, not 5. so let me know if you guys want a summer edition as well."
1,is my shopping haul as a minimalist so first i got sleeping mask i have two of these but i don't wash them often enough and i don't want any eye infection so i got this really cute one for not much money but it's hopefully should last me a while then i got this brawler um i could also use it as a shirt if i'm feeling kind of but wild i guess um i didn't need a bras for like four years but haven't found any i liked and i've also been in need of some cute tops so i kind of combine them because i don't have much space and it's more practical so this is another one i got the sports bra which i could also double as a crop top i got another one in this blue color they're both pretty cheap from target and then i got two tops haha one in white and one in black and these are from unicorn and their little crop t shirts cause i was in need of these and so this is the black one it's so everything i got it absolutely love and make sure there are prices that were within my budget and there were things that i've actually been needing for a long time so that is my minimalist hall
1,"shop with me at Uniqlo. first of all, don't forget to check out their collaboration t shirts with artists like Andy Warhol. this pair of joggers are so, so comfy and has fuzzies inside. love the Disney collection as well. this beautiful periwinkle colored sweatshirt is so gorgeous. love the embroidered detail. and this is a very elegant office friendly look with the collar cardigan paired with these smart pants that feel so comfortable and really high quality. this shopper bag. gives me a Hermes vibe. really high quality, adjustable and can fit all of your essentials. love the color. if you want a cozy cardigan. definitely check out Uniqlo. this is such gorgeous silhouette and looks so cozy. this is a thinner, more casual version of the cardigan. I love the drape. Uniqlo has really quality blazer as well. usually a wool or wool blend. love the button detail. then I tried on this satin puffer coat so comfortable and super super lightweight. love the silhouette. this next coat gives me a little bit of totem vibes. it's really cool in terms of the shape. it centers you in on the waist and I love the flare effect. you can also button it all the way up or pair it with the famous Uniqlo moon back. that comes in so many colors. I love these neutral tones. it fits 1t super lightweight, and these are the popular colors in comparison."
0,Your clothes while literally wearing an all Uniqlo fit.
1,"Right, I'm just heading off to a Uniqlo event. I thought I quickly show you what I'm wearing. It is so hot and muggy in London at the moment, but I thought I had to wear my Uniqlo trousers. These are my absolute favourite white like trousers that I've been able to find. I find that they just fit really well on the waist. Also, I'm a short girl and I feel like lots of trousers really drag on the floor for me, whereas these are kind of perfect length. And then I'm just wearing a linen shirt from Arquette. Can't receive it. My New Balance 5 50s. My bag is from Polen and then my sunnies are from key. So, yeah, that's my little outfit of the day."
1,"Come with me to build a fall outfit at Uniqlo. A lot of nice outerwear came out in the fall winter collection, and so let's try on and build an outfit around this pile lined jacket. I want to keep this outfit in a fall color tone. The first thing that caught my eye was this brown cable knit sweater. I also grabbed this white Uniqlo U tee to try on the jacket with different bases. The pants I went with are these off-white low rise baggy jeans. For men's pants, I'm usually a 33 or 34 waist, but for these, even a size 30 or 31 fits a little bit loose on me, so keep that in mind. This is the whole outfit using fall brown tones. I like the fit of the jacket and how the arm sleeves slightly flare out, but I'm not a huge fan of the size of the collar. I switched out the sweater for the T-shirt, and to be honest, I think I'm feeling this one much better. Let me know what you guys think and if this was helpful, follow for more."
1,"List of basics for a man's closet part one. That's right I'm returning the series and the list is thought of as if you have nothing in your closet, as if you were going to start from scratch,. You may already have several of these things but still check it out. First on the list is a Lisa t-shirt in black and white, beige is also perfect, some cream gray color but with a black and white base. Now I know that not everyone looks like the examples I'm putting right now, but that does not mean that I hope everyone looks like that,. These are pieces that should fit your body type. Some brands that I can recommend you to check are these from here, but obviously it doesn't mean they have to be from there, they are just recommendations. Second on the list is a leather jacket,. I repeat leather, not vinyl. Vinyl is much cheaper than leather and you can usually get it in h and m,. Zara,. Forever twenty one, any Fast fashion place, but vinyl lasts much less. Obviously here comes the price-quality ratio, but I recommend that since these are the foundations of your outfits you should invest so that you can wear them repeatedly and not run out. Now Obviously leather is more expensive. A hack I can give you for this is to buy it second hand, there are a lot of second hand stores on. Instagram that I can put you right now, you can go to your trusted tiis in your city,. I swear you will find it there, but obviously when it is second hand you have to look for it but it is worth it. Now how many styles of leather jackets? This one is a more vintage aviator style, probably their' closets have them and can be stolen,. This one for example is a much more modern and simple style, it is a basic total. This is a classic rock and roll jacket, obviously the vibe changes depending on the style you choose but you will look good. And the third recommendation I'm going to give you in this part is a jacket and here the tip I'm going to give you is not to buy it super tight, we want it a little looser because we want to make layers, so buy it thinking that there will be more layers under this jacket. It is not in oversize cut as it reaches the hip but if what you are looking for is something more oversize then it can end up below the hip. It's still going to look good. Simply the vibe changes. A very good brand of is Levi's, but it's obviously a bit more expensive. So again I leave you the tip to make it second hand. That's how I bought my jacket. These are some second-hand Instagram accounts that are trusted. Check it out. This is the art of dress, the art of personal style. And art takes time and effort, but it's always worth it. See you in part two."
1,"Hello friend. I just went shopping yesterday so we just unboxed as well try on. T-shirt that Uniqlo collaborated with studio ghibli. I love seeing the details in this pocket. Look at the writing is also funny. I mix and match with loose jeans. Continue to wear the 2nd product cardigan later and the 4th square hijab. This is a cardigan and it's like a smooth nude. Like this is the smoothest nude that I found at Uniqlo yesterday I bought a size XL because I don't want one like too made. I mix and match the white pants from echinos. Then I wear the embroidered pashmina. It's like a plain shirt and pants. It's funny that next friend here has an inner that I often use. I already have uh 4 and this means the 5th. Especially if for example the clothes are like here is a bit open. You don't have to fix it for me. It's really important because he's a turtle neck. Yes,. I bought the turtle neck. Last time there was studio ghibli again. Here I bought the green color because I really like the green color and the front picture is like this studio ghibli writing and the back is totoro. Why is that pororo? I am a couple with this Totoro. I mix and match the first pair of jeans. Keep wearing pashmina shirts. You sound like a tomboy. Friend? Apa?"
1,"Come with me on a London staycation with Uniqlo! So headed into London around two PM before checking into the Treehouse Hotel which is one of my faves and dropping my bags here before heading straight to the Uniqlo store on. Oxford Circus to check out their fallen winter issue which was just stunning. I cannot wait to show you guys more of that! Then we span this whale which basically the idea of this is whatever it lands on is the challenge to go and hunt down an outfit around this. So me and Bronte both got vivid colour for this which was super exciting cause you guys and girls know I love a bit of colour. So grabbed our bags and headed into store checking out the new cord crossbody bags which I am obsessed with. How stunning are they? And the girls tried on some fluffy fleeces. There was lots of amazing winter pieces and the new bandeau that has like removable bra in built pads and also straps and adjustable straps and I am obsessed with their tank top versions of this so I was very excited about the Bando version. Then I tried on this gorgeous coat that felt like foam swayed on the inside like so soft and I loved. And then I tried on this tan coat and hat which comes in multiple different colours as well. Then we headed straight to the training rooms. I tried on this loungewear set which was Super soft. Again, comes in multiple colours. Then this peachy net and this purple lilac one. These come in around eight to 10 different colours and I just fell in love. Now this is the start of the show. These jeans. So these come in 6 different colours, different shapes and lengths, and I am obsessed. I, I literally gonna be wearing these on repeat. They are gorgeous. And then I tried on the lilac linen blend trousers. I have these in white and love them. And then I went and tried on the jeans and some other sizes and a few of the knits and some other sizes, but ended up resulting in the lilac cause I loved it so much. And then we chose our pieces and actually went and tried on some hats. I mean, I cannot pull off a Berry. I wish I could. Before getting little embroidered details on some bags so you can get this done in store, which is so fun. You can get on socks, teas, bags. Bronte got this little heart and Chessie also got one, but I didn't get a video of that. Before we bought a few extra little. It's for autumn winter. And also this is Jesse giving me Ray's new go so that I don't get drenched, basically. But we managed to miss the rain on our way to the hotel before changing for a beautiful dinner at Medina Madeira. I always get that wrong. And we Had some cocktails and canopies before heading into the restaurant. The food here is 10 out of 10. I came here for my birthday two years ago and absolutely loved it. We had some tacos and sharing, like, flatbreads, and we got so lucky with the sunset. Look at that. How stunning the dessert was. Also 10 out of 10. And then we got some sweets to head back to our room. And the views here are just gorgeous. I had an amazing little shower, and now I'm in bed. So I will see you guys tomorrow. Lots of love. Bye."
0,"Three outfits from fall using pieces from unicorn. So for this first outfit,. I wanted to keep it more relaxed and casual. So starting off with the pants, we have the wide pleated trousers in the gray color, and I normally don't wear gray trousers, so I wanted to style it pretty simple with this coach jacket into a bag, and my Margiela gats so often. Number two is definitely more straightforward. We have the wool varsity jacket over the just a black shirt, wide parachute trousers, which is covering my Burberry vans graph No. 3. This is definitely an outfit for when you're in a rush and you just don't have that much time to get ready. We have the black zip up jacket, and then he just simple black T-shirt. Josh and bag, the white denim, and then the a cold wall converse."
1,"Nicola is having a moment right now because everything they have on their site is so good. Never wear long skirts, but this one was so comfortable and so flattering. On sale for 8. Black vest had a nice weight, and it felt like it was made out of good material. These trousers are literally my dream pants. This style is so flattering. You can dress it up or down. It's the perfect color and length, especially for someone short like me. It's always a struggle to find the pants that hit you in the right spots. And lastly, this top in leggings, guys, the airism softler leggings is where it's at. I've tried so many different brands, but I've never felt a material like this one. Always loved Uniqlo, but this season is the best it's ever been."
1,"I've come to 1 place to pick up some gifts for Christmas. And now I show you my favorites. You have like this section of thermal T-shirts, they are super thin and warm for 14.90. And you have in 1 lot of colors. You also have these coats here, this little sheepskin coat, which is my favorite, and cost 69 and now I'm wearing 49. And for me these are the best white t-shirts, which are these from here, for 14.90. And look at this section, it's great. You have this whole wall of jackets like this in all these colors for 34.90. You also have these raincoats that I love, they are like that picture, super quilts and 109. And you also have all these sweaters that I showed them once, that the other time I picked up this one that is super soft, for 34.90 too. And you have this trend here that cost 129, which you also have in Black. The black trench coat would look like this in size x s. I think I'm going to take this one. And all this you see here are feathers like this or cute little vests in all these colors and that take up very little, for 69.90. And you have 1 section where there are 1 pile of beanies, gloves and matching scarves. Look, there are all these with gloves and scarves. And these are the fleeces I picked up the other time I picked up the one Fran is wearing, since you have it in many more colors, for 34. And Fran has learned this one, which she loves, in blue, which is 129. And this bag here had gone superviral,. I got it. And there are all these colors that I love this one, for 14. And in the Chico part I just found 2 bombers that I love, it's this one here and this one,. I mean, they are the same ones, this one is in blue and this one in gray. This is the men's x s and it looks oversized like this, but I like the butt here. And for Chico there is this overshirt that is also available in gray, reduced from 69 to 49. I find here my little things and in another video I show you what I got."
0,"But this was years ago. The cat is definitely judging me right now. This is crooked. How's it going? Thought I would do a 'get ready with me', so that's what I'm gonna do. These are the pleated shorts from Uniqlo. They said they had more in stock, like on clearance, but like all the sizes were sold out so. Handy vest from HM. We've got this really funky camera patterned shirt, camp collar shirt from Farfield UK. Had this thing for years, and you know, I just realized they look so good together. But I'm trying not to just wear these pants over and over again. Like I'm gonna wear these pants over and over again but like, for this video's sake, gonna try something new. Never watch the movie The Lovely Bones? I've been watching little clips of it on TikTok, and I've already seen the movie, and holy crap, I'm greatly troubled by that movie. I'm retraumatized. I didn't realize how terrifying that video was. I don't know, younger me didn't really get it because uh, Stanley Tucci holy crap. I follow him on TikTok, and now I'm just terrified of him again. So I'm gonna have to watch Devil Wears Prada about 15 times to quell that fear that I have of him. So yeah, that's the fit. It's pretty basic. I'm trying to kind of experiment with different pieces and kinda mixing and matching. Of course, there's cat hair because cats. Um but yeah, so I'm not a huge fan of this color combo, but I gotta give it a shot and try to expand just a little bit. Thanks so much for watching. Have a great day and follow for more. We're gonna go with these Cole Haans because I haven't worn them in a while and I don't mind them, especially for the casual things and errands that I'm gonna run. So you like these, Macy, okay?"
1,"Okay, I'm wearing this green Roaneck from Ralph Lauren. It keeps you really, really warm. Please relax. Feet. Greyish black denim pants from cores. And I'm going to wear this cool green boots. I got from Coles. I said no longer go. Prepare to be sick of me wearing these boots, because it is perfect for this time of the year. Here they are. I know, right? So good. I'm going to complete the look with this cool quilted jacket from Uniqlo. Yes! This is so cozy. You know when you wear something that you like so much and you just feel so good? This is so good.

1,"Hi guys! Come with me on a little shopping day! First up I got my favorite milk tea and then headed over to Dellamo Mall in Torrance. First up was Urban Outfitters. I wanted to see their Bagu stock but they didn't really have much. Second stop was my fave Uniqlo. They had a cute Snoopy collection and a lot of the new colors for the bags. I went specifically for this dress and I'm glad I found it because I'm so obsessed and I didn't end up buying it. I also bought a couple basic tees, just a black and white one. 3rd stop was H and M. This one's huge cause it's 2 stories. Didn't really find anything here. My final stop was typo, which is one of my favorite stationary stores. Every time I come here I wanna spend so much because they have the cutest notebooks, totes, bags, literally everything. So I ended up buying this laptop case and this multi zipper pen case. And that, my friends, is a successful day of shopping."

But then I found one more of these, and I also found this. So I bought the melody one is so cute. It's pink. That was the best find from Daiso, by the way. I got all this for my damn design, so. And I got this plant. It's so cute. Then I got this. A mini vase. I think I could put, like, some, like, dried flowers in it or something. And I really like the blue eyes. A very nice blue color. Mother freaking way I spend 30. I also got this vase, you know, so cute. I can put more dry flowers in here. And then I got this photo frame. I was debating whether I should get, like, the gray or the turquoise, but I decided to get the gray one. For organizer. I'm just gonna put my skincare in here. Uh, we got one more organizer. I'm gonna put, like,. My perfume on here. And we got this, uh, I'm gonna put my face wash and my 4 o device here. Yeah. And then I got these two. Is to write letters.

And then he got a white Arizona because some reason he doesn't own Arizona. Then I got this cute pajama set from 68. I love it. And these are the shots. This is my thought one already. It's also."
1,"You guys already know my obsession with Ralph Lauren models. Well, yesterday Ralph Lauren came back to the runway at New York Fashion Week. My invite probably got lost in the mail, but this is what I would have worn if I went. Starting with the most basic but perfect neutrals, both are from the Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection. I have never worn anything from the purple collection, but the tailoring is just amazing. Also love that you can make the size smaller with these little things. It is very warm in New York, but nothing like a cashmere crew neck from Ralph Lauren. Let's tuck it in. When I tell you I've dreamt of wearing the suede Ralph Lauren shirt for so many years... well, dreams do come true. I present to you my dream, this purple blue jean suede shirt that I got on Saks.com, just like the Pinterest inspiration. I'm thinking, let's do a tuck into the pants. What the model has is basically the three buttons just closed, and then when it looks like this, we gonna come and tuck in the shirt into the pants. By the way, I don't think I've ever felt a more smooth and bendable leather, which really feels like a real shirt and also really reminds me of Tuscany because of the leather scent. While I don't have the Purple Label boots, this outfit screams the need for brown boots. These ones are literally the dupe for the Saint Laurent, they're from Ranch Roads and they're such amazing quality. I really feel like this ties in the outfit together. I really think let's keep the jewelry minimal, Infinity link bracelet by Maison Spoiled, and my snake ring. Tom Ford sunglasses, by the way, everything you see here is literally from Saks. They really have the best Ralph Lauren selection. And this, ladies and gentlemen, would have been my final look if I was going to the show. Ralph Lauren, please hire me"
1,"Spend a productive day in my life with me this morning, as we assume, for I made pumpkin pancakes and then I got ready to go out to Costa, where I spent 3 hours editing my YouTube video. Later on today,. I went TK Maxx. They have such a good range this year, and I was really impressed with all the different variety of candles that they have this year."
1,"Back by popular demand, today we're recreating this Polo Ralph Lauren bear outfit, starting simple with these oversized cream pants from the Frankie Shop. They have the perfect pleats, just like the bear. No secret for the shirt, it is the Polo Ralph Lauren Classic white shirt. Let's tuck that in. Okay, but why would I literally wear this out? Don't hate me, but my most similar tie is the same Tom Ford striped black tie. Working as an influencer means I've never purchased good ties, but let's collectively imagine that there's a red stripe, red sweater for the wrap-around. As a kid, I would always wear my sweaters like this, literally on point. My most similar jacket to this Ralph Lauren one is this Saint Laurent Velvet Blue, definitely a little more suited, but I think it works well. As a compromise to the gold embroidery on his jacket, I present to you the most gorgeous yellow diamond brooch that will be the perfect bougie replacement for that gold embroidery, from the brand Maison Spoiled. I mean, it's pretty similar. I know the bear has brown loafers, but I have the most incredible Polo Ralph Lauren loafers with the thing from his jacket, but we gotta respect the outfits, so Polo Ralph Lauren loafers. And here is the complete outfit. What do we think? Did I nail it or what? Kisses."
1,"Okay, y'all come with me to the farm. We're about to take some holiday photos. My theme this year was Ralph Lauren Christmas ad, and we nailed it. Look at our outfits. We're in the Ralph Lauren signature Christmas plaid, and I am in heaven. We're on a black owned farm taking pictures with the horses, giving our best smiles, looking phenomenal even though it was freezing outside. Um, my hair, I got box braids, not loose box braids, for these photos, and the color actually matches. Match the horse's mane. Isn't that nice? It was a beautiful day. The sky was so blue, and I lived out my dreams taking photos with my family. Thank you so much, Latro."
-1,"Let's get dressed for a fancy dinner tonight. I'm basing my outfit off of these heels also. They're from BCBG. Like who remembers that? Thinking about wearing this Ralph Lauren,. I think I'm gonna wear a navy skirt with this. My boyfriend's going in a white and navy suit. I don't think I like this at all. It just makes me look bigger. I definitely prefer a blue up over white. Everything that I'm wearing just feels wrong right now. Honestly, don't know how I feel about this school uniform. I don't know. Okay, so I went to the initial look. I'll be wearing my Ralph Lauren, a trend coat with this look will stay on theme with my coach handbag in this color to match the heels and T-shirt. That's what I'm wearing tonight."
1,"Okay, so I went shopping today with my mom. We're going shopping later, too. Um, if you couldn't tell, that's literally all we do when we're here is we go shopping. So I'm gonna do a little haul. I'm gonna start with anthropology. Um, the first thing I listen to what I got. I got this brown reformation sweater hair clips to put my hair back when I'm doing my makeup. I've wanted them for so long, and I finally found a cute pair. We spent a grand at Sebora. Um,. I needed to load up here because I don't have anything, and I forgot so much stuff. So let's get into this. I'm gonna like. So this also has stuff that my mom got, but, um, first thing I got is the Kiehl's Retinol. Daily Retinol. I'm out of mine. And then my mom got, uh, L'oreal. She also got a YSL bear. Look 10 at the Bobby Brown Vitamin D base. This is the best primer. If you guys have not used it, you should definitely try it out. It's amazing. And then my mom also got another lancome product, this supergroup. And this one. I got Golden Hour and Sunrise. I got two because I get so much more tan here. Then I got the Amika dream routine. This is my favorite hair mask. I'm gonna put this in and slick my hair back tonight. Then she had the Y. So another one my mom has, like,. So much makeup, you guys. It's, like, insane. Um, I got the superfood conditioner because I don't have any shampoo or conditioner here, and I need to wash my hair. And then I got the shampoo. Then I got the Charlotte Tilbury Magic cream. I decided that I needed. It was, like, made my skin looks so good the other day when I did my makeup. Then I'm got a Y sell lip thing. She got the mini Bobby brown. And then I got a mini glow recipe toner because I was using my sister's, and I just didn't get my own. And then my mom got the Westman. Tellier Vital Skin Complex Drops. And then I got two NARS concealers. I got 2.3 and 2.5 1.235. And then the last thing I got was the Superfood Air Whip moisture cream. This is my favorite, um, moisturizer. I'm just gonna leave it here so if I ever forget it,. I have it. Okay, next, let's. Let's do Ralph Lauren. Um, so I got something, and then I got something for my boyfriend, and he deleted TikTok, so he won't see this. Um, if you know him and you show him this,. I will be very upset because it's surprised. So I got myself this for my mom. Got me this sweater. So cute. I've been wanting one for so long. I was between that and tan, and I got that one. And then I, like. My love language is like, Gifts. Like, I love buying my boyfriend gifts, so I got him this Ralph Lauren little sweatshirt thing in a large. It's so cute and so, like, his style. Like, he's gonna wear this all the time. He's gonna look so adorable in it. So I got him that. And then last but not least,. I got this bag. Me and my mom are gonna share it. She bought it. It is. She has it in brown. Okay. She already has in brown, so I was like,. I'll take it most of the time, and then we can pass it off. It's the new Lueve bag, and they had one left in. This is a size small. Like, how cute is this? I can't wait to, like, wear this. I'm so obsessed with it. So we're gonna, like, switch on and off because she has it in brown already, so, like, yeah, we're gonna share it. It'll end up staying with me. But how cute. And then yesterday,. I bought myself this Chanel 2 5 5 bag, and then we're going shopping today. I also got a bunch of stuff from Zimmerman, but it is not able to be purchased until Tuesday because it's a new collection. But if you guys are thinking about buying a Chanel bag, do it now. There's a price increase either at the beginning of November, the end of November. It's either before or after cruise. But how Chanel works,. I'm guessing it's gonna be Before cruise. If you're planning on getting a bag, get it now. It's gonna be 13. Nobody wants to pay that."

I thrifted but it was like. I literally couldn't tell you these. I got at Belk which were on sale on my Friday and they were super cute flag sweater is Ralph Lauren the skirt I actually got on Princess Polly it's like this corduroy it's like brown like it doesn't show as well on camera but the brown matches like the cream and like the blacks that's why I put it together yeah the shoes like they so cute are the moment the strap actually like goes up on the back here but I got like the worst blisters cause I had to walk to work thought it was a good idea and I thought these should be super comfortable my first time wearing them ever don't ever do that literally don't ever do that um anyway walk 20 minutes and then started bleeding before I even got to work um it was really traumatic and I had to re lace them and yes that was traumatic but this shoes are so cute nonetheless but that was the outfit of the day

1,"Okay, so it's round two of dressing like the Polo Bear, and I'm gonna do this outfit but with a twist. Step one is complete. I know it's giving ""no place like home,"" it's giving Dorothy, but it's gonna look really cute with the lettering that I have and the crew neck. Comparing it with, so I don't have the green one that the bear had, but I think this one's pretty cute. I think that the border of the lettering in the Hamptons is gonna go really well with the navy blue in this, it's gonna make the pink pop too. Okay, so far, I'm absolutely loving it. I'm obsessed. I think it's really cute. It makes me wanna go play tennis or something, but I am gonna roll up the sleeve because I think that'll look cuter. Ah, a vibe, stunning, darling, stunning. So, these are the cargo pants that I thought would match, but it's not giving to me, it's kinda giving like baggy on baggy, which I don't really love. Um, I kinda feel like, I'm just gonna say it, I feel like a lesbian. No hate to my lesbians, I'm part of the LGBT myself, but it's just not giving to me. Sorry, ladies and gents. Okay, so I think this is better. I like this a little bit tighter. It's giving more like Lady Diana in her little Harvard fit, you know, with her New Balances. Less like I'm gonna go paint a house, I'm like, I'm not a carpenter, you know? I'm more of like a, hmm, so cute, okay. So there you have it, another Polo bear outfit video. Um, I think it's so cute, such a vibe. I'm gonna continue this trend and make more videos on it, so if you hated it, too bad, so sad."
1,"Okay, so here's my fit check. I'm at Ralph Lauren right now, sporting a YSL bag and Ralph Lauren coat, paired with some beautiful riding boots. For the top, I've chosen something from Aritzia, and for the bottoms, Abercrombieyes, the curvy fit, size 25. Accessorizing with a piece from Hermes. And just a little side note, I don't have my ears pierced, so that wraps up today's ensemble!"
0,"Hey guys, I'm back with another haul for you. I leave tomorrow morning on a 15 hour flight to Africa, and I've yet to pack one thing. So all of these should help me with that. Okay. I ordered this dress from Free People. Like, it's cute. I just. I'm not, like, obsessed, but, like, it's cute. I got it in black, but the black one is like, way too big, so I'm gonna have to, like, send that back or something. Okay, next up is this little boys Ralph Lauren tea. Right now, it is huge, but I'm gonna get it cropped, so imagine it like this. It's gonna be cute. Little, like, retro fit. Okay, we're missing a lot. Okay, just checked my Amazon and all my stuff. It's supposed to be coming in late. Kind of disappointed. I was supposed to show you all this, but I got a little makeup brush set, more rollers, a thing to, like, protect my makeup brushes, and then these little heatless curl things. Anyways, pray for me, guys. I hope they get in before my flight tomorrow."
1,"This is number 2 of my fashion spring haul. We still have a lot of to unpack. If you haven't watched part one, please do so. I'm always out of breath when I film. I don't know why, sweetie. Weird. But, yeah. I got this gorgeous LaCoste polo dress. When I saw it on the website, I needed to have it. It is so beautiful. Of course, it needs an ironing or steaming, but it goes a little bit over your knees. I think this is a perfect length for me. And it's a dark a blue, so navy blue. I will try to put a picture of. It's absolutely beautiful. I cannot wait to wear this. By the way, I mentioned in part one, if you want to get anything,. I actually linked everything in my. Like to know it. The link is in my bio, but, yeah. Um, next item that I got, it was on sale, and I am obsessed is this Ralph Lauren polo top. I feel that. Follow me. You know,. I'm obsessed with Ralph Lauren. I just love the brand, and I think it's very simple, but very classic. And this is the polo, and I really, really love this. I cannot wait again to style this. I haven't found a link for this, but if you do, let me know. And the next T-shirt is also from Ralph Lauren. This is a children's T-shirt. So let me explain. I wanted a stripy Ralph Lauren T-shirt, but it was a sold out. And then I went to check on the children's section because they have size until one 64. One sixty one seventy two. And I. And it's actually big on me, so I'm more than happy for that. I think with a pair of jeans, some loafers, this looks like a very casual, elegant look. And I'm really excited about this thing. Is gonna be surprising to you. This is Buckethead from Ralph Lauren again. And I just really think it's so cute. By the pool or like in the summer. Um, I'm not gonna try on camera cause I'm not gonna embarrass myself, but I really, really love this. And it's surprising to you because it doesn't look like my usual style, but wait until you see the whole look, cause it's gonna look great. But yeah. Fun fact about me, had somebody suit me that much. I don't wear a lot of hats because I just think they don't look good on my face. I think that you're either a glasses or a hat person. There's some very rare people that are blessed with both. I'm not one of them. And this is probably one of my favorite pieces. This is the Ralph Lauren cardigan. It's from their new collection, spring collection. I'm obsessed with pink. I think it's this color that suits me very well. And I am so excited to wear this. It's so cute. Thing that I got. Is this top and I got it in 3 colours. The black in beige white, kinda off white,. I don't know what you call it. Off white. Just a beige white. And I got this because I think it's a great basic top. I really love the cut. I know this is really great for my body shape. And I got 3 of them because if something is good, get in different colors if you can."
1,"The same goes for this outfit- I love the suede vest under the blazer, as he pretty much strictly dresses with Americana in mind. This one is phenomenal. His style stays true to his brand's ethos,. This one is crazy. with the long coat is an unexpectedly good combo. And this one is definitely one of my top picks. The cropped orange jacket with the Polo flight cargos is perfect. So here are some of his best outfits. Even though Ralph Lauren just turned 83 years old,. Ralph was wearing super wide fit jeans before any of y'all. The layering here is very well done, he still has one of the best personal style identities I've ever seen. The trousers tucked into the boots. Not to mention his Bugatti 57SC in the background. and this belt buckle is so cool. This is him walking out after 2006 runway show. and the fade on that leather jacket is unreal."
1,"All right, me and Leo are going to open a package we got today. Right, Leo? We got it from Bloomingdale, and I know it's not fancy, but it was on sale, I promise. So let's see what we got from Leo. Okay, let's see what we got here. Okay. Oh, my goodness. Look at this. Okay, let's open the next one, Leo. What a cutie. Look at this. All right, our next Ralph Lauren piece is this cute little sailor, which Leo is super excited about. You could look at this. Uh, I love these. They're just, like, super old looking. Not old looking. Like old money vibes. Like old, you know? You guys know what I'm talking about. So I love the color. Really cute. That's all my goodies. Oh, my gosh. I wanted more. Okay. Buh. Bye."
1,"I'm leaving Vienna today. I wanted to do a quick little haul of what I got. First thing is these gloves. They're these beautiful leather gloves, and they're actually cashmere lines. They're super warm. And then I just got this really simple white scarf, because I've been freezing cold since I've been here. And I also got this Ralph Lauren sweater, which I think is so cute. This winter store I went to had a ton of, like,. Re Up sweaters, basically. Also got this cashmere sweater, which I love the color of. And then I also just got this plain gray sweatshirt because I didn't really bring any warm, comfy clothes. I also thrifted these boots. Again, I needed warmer clothes. I think these are a perfect neutral color to wear the rest of my trip. And then this sweater I'm so excited about. It has bell sleeves. How cute is this? I'm. It's so good. And then this parts boring, but I went to Brandy because that's where I get my underwear, and I'm almost out. And then I got gray sweatpants, because, again, no warm, comfy clothes, and a white T-shirt. And that's all I got."
1,"Ralph Lauren is selling their products for one cent and one. So I just got my order, and I'm gonna Unbox it and open it with you guys, and you guys can see what I got. This is a really big and heavy boxes. I'm not sure why the. The other box is bigger than the other one, but let's just open it. I got a thank you card. Oh, my god. And then I got, like, a. A card from them, which is really nice. Like. Like a card you can fill in. I got a bunch. Oh, my god. So I got this sweater. Uh, I got an red. I love the white. The white one. And then I got this blue color and the navy color. I love this. It's perfect for fall and winter. I live in Florida, so it doesn't get really cold, but I'm from Indonesia, and it's also hot there. But I think this is cute for layering or stuff, and it's just so pretty. I think my favorite color, personally, is this, too. But the red is perfect for Christmas. And, yeah,. I think the other one is the same, uh, coloring the same sweater. So I'm just. I'm not gonna record it, but this is. This is. This. This is a worth it."
1,"Ralph Lauren haul for my toddler, kicking off with these adorable little socks. Then we've got a green cap paired with a matching tee, absolutely precious. Moving on to the cutest sweatsuit you've ever seen  it's all about those charming little details. And for those warm summer vibes, a PK romper, topped off with a flag sweater, not for the little one this time, but for mama."
1,right chaps. I finally picked up my suit after having it tailored for the wedding. Im attending this weekend and I'm beyond pleased with the result watch until the end see a full body clip you can see how it looked prior to tailoring in my last video the trousers were taken in but they're still slightly baggy like before. I was worried. I'd end up with a skinny suit dressed like a recruiter hes my dad helping me decide what tie to wear personally I think the pink and blue striped ones look the best but let me know what you think the jacket was probably taken in the most out of everything and I think it looks so much better now. I also tried out a pocket square which I thought looked quite good. I actually ended up having to get the back shortened twice here's a before and here's an after you can see how much of a difference it's made ultimately my dad suggested. I wear a different suit as it wouldn't be fair on all the husbands to look this good at the wedding when their wives were around. I'll be posting video of the suit I ended up wearing later on all in all the tailoring cost me 165 which I think is an absolute steal and I'm so so pleased with how this turned out
1,"Birthday haul. Just as a little disclaimer,. I'm very grateful for everything I got. And also because my birthday is close to Christmas, a lot of these are joint birthday and Christmas gifts, so just keep that in mind. Let's get right into it. The first thing I got is this Tory Burch bracelet. It's so pretty, and it's like a bangle. So you pull it right here in this unclasps, and then you put it on. It's great. I love it. Next is Brandy. I also got these sweats that I'm wearing right now, but I got way too excited to wait to make this, so I was just wearing them. But let's show you everything else that I got.

I got this digital camera SD card reader so that I can put the SD card in it and it will go directly to my phone so I don't have to do it through my computer anymore. This is a really good present. Like, whoever thought of this for me is so smart. My cousin got it for me. I got the Elf Brow lift, this white Hollister Gilly Hicks top, and it's like nylon material so it won't peel, which I'm really happy about. My sister got that one for me. I got new Lululemon leggings, which are so good for ice skating. Like, I needed some new ones. I'm really happy grandma got these for me. Also for my birthday, my family is going to New York, so my mom got me some, like, winter coats for New York, so I'm really excited about those. But they're really cute. Like, I really like them. These are the coats. This one's from Zara. It has these, like, buttons on it, and it's really cute. And I'll wear it with, like, a pink hat, pink scarf. I mean, white hat, white scarf, white gloves. And then same thing for this one. This one's from Ralph Lauren. I like that it's like a more, like, chocolatey brown, and it's like, the same type of thing. It's really cute. It's like, I'm going for, like, the clean girl. New York aesthetic. Also, if you look close, in my videos,. I'm always wearing this, like, pink robe. I literally got that for my 10th birthday, and I continue to wear it, and my mom noticed, so she got me a actual, like, nice robe. This is basically, like, what it looks like. Wait, hold up. Oh, yeah, this is basically what it looks like. It's really comfy and cute. It looks like a hotel room, so I love that. Also, I got this lip oil. It's called the Clarins Lip Oil, and it's so pretty. I tried it on, and it's, like, so pretty. I love this tint, the Color 0 3, and the Lip Comfort Oil, so I actually really recommend that. That's everything I got from friends and family, but I also got some PR packages. First one is this, um,. Victor and Rolf, um, thing. This is their scent, good fortune. And. Okay,. I'm gonna just show you this ball. I, I peaked. But this bottle is so pretty. Like, look at this bottle. Tell me it's not like, something you literally seen, like, a movie. Looks like a potion. If you can't really see from the video, this is what it looks like. And they also sent me the travel size. This is such a good, like, signature set,. I feel like. And Kiel sent me something, so I haven't opened it. I mean, I've, like, undone it, but I haven't, like, seen what's inside, so let's look together. Oh, wait. They sent me so much stuff. Oh, my god. Wait. It's so cutely wrapped. And they wrote me, like, a little note. Okay, well, let's go through this. They gave me these two pairs of super soft, fuzzy socks from Barefoot Dreams. Um, they gave me an apotheki candle. I don't even think this is Kiel's brand. This is just, like, a candle they decided to give me. It's chard fig. Oh, my mom will actually love that. And they also gave me one called Birchwood Apple. Wait. I wanna smell them. It's purple. Wait. Oh. Oh, my gosh. It's so pretty. It says apotheki right here. I can't really smell it because I think I need to burn it to smell it, but it smells good and, like, it's really pretty. Whoa. Onto the actual Kiehl stuff. They gave me this richly hydrating hand care trio. It has, like, um, hand lotion and stuff like that. And they gave me a Mighty Moisture essentials kit with, like, all of their, like, go TOS. Like, their. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Like, everything. And they gave me their avocado eye treatment, which is literally my favorite thing ever. They got me a Mary masking, which has, like, minis of every single one of their masks. And you open it like this,. I guess. Oh, wait. This is so cute. I said, this is so cute 14 times at this video, but, like,. I'm so excited, like, I. I can't articulate myself. And this is their hydrate all the way starter kit that has their cleanser and their, like, facial cream. This is actually incredible. Kiels is, like, my go to. Like,. I feel like it's very trusted. It's, like, feels like a doctor's office. Is very clean brand. And, like, when I. When I'm using kiels, my skin is, like, good. Like, right now,. I'm not using kiels, like, down here. I mostly use it on my cheeks. And, like, look, my. My skin is bad. So I'm actually so happy about that. That's like Christmas. Thank you to kiels and Victor and Ralf for those awesome packages, and I hope you guys enjoyed the video. Let me know what you guys think. Bye."
0,"No, because this is literally why I created a tennis and pickleball brand. I grew up wearing a lot of Lululemon stuff to play, but it never actually worked for the sport. And so I decided that I was gonna design something, especially a dress, that would actually work and also be the cutest athletic dress you've ever seen. And it goes on sale tomorrow."
0,"My boss let me buy 2,000 worth of Lululemon. So let's see what we got. So none of this is actually for me. I am in charge of picking, uh. What are they called? Those, like, things that you wear uniforms for people at work. And it's all Lululemon. So here are some of the items that I picked for them to try. Um, this has never happened to me in my life. I literally just opened this package. Oh, it's not for me. I thought this was Lululemon. I opened it, and it's not even for me. I was like, why did Lululemon send me George shirts? I have to give this to this person. Oh, my god."
-1,okay i just got back my local lemon and i found these shorts in store i picked them up so fast and ran to the fitting room and i'm showing you this picture because this is what i was imagining them to look like on i always size up in shorts so i sized up to a size six when i was trying them on let me just show you what they look like let's just say i'm not a huge fan of these shorts the mesh was really long the overall short was too tight there was no drawstring and yeah i'm gonna pass
1,"Lululemon package to open. I literally came home to 4 of them, so huge haul. So this is funny. Um, I saw people saying that the lip gloss buffet came on early access on the app that I was so scared, and, like, I thought my order didn't go through, and so I ordered 2 of them because I was like, okay, wait, like, what if my order gets canceled? And then I was just like, oh, why did I order 2 on the same order? Now it's definitely gonna get canceled. Then I ordered another one separately. So when I go to store next week to return these,. I'm gonna make some girls really happy. I just didn't want it to get canceled and not get the beltbags. I really, really wanted it, and now I have 3. So they're shopping at the same Lululemon as I am next weekend. Be there cause you'll see these. You're welcome."
0,"Okay, so I wasn't actually sure if I owned anything in poolside, so I pulled out my laptop and pulled up my Lululemon closet, and I do. So it took me a second to find it, but here it is. So let's pair it with a few colors. Black, Sonic Pink,. Java Nomad Lip Gloss,. Raw Linen, Heathered Gray. Let me know what you think."
-1,"literally just have the biggest lululemon fail. so I just got this top. Courtney Kahoot on here was like ranting and raving about how cute it is. she's like, I do, like, high fit classes. nothing slides down. it's all great. I put it on first thing this morning, and I was like, okay, it's cute. it's a little small. I wore it to the gym and you guys one, this color on me. I literally looked nude. okay, it not flattering not it for me. second, the non strap side was rolling down. keep in mind. I was just doing legs. I was not even raising my arms. like, I went like, this to, like, grab something. and I was like, oh, my gosh. I'm like going to fall out of this and I have nothing there. I've come to the conclusion though. maybe it's cause I have a super long torso, so like, it looks microscopic to begin with. and then like, maybe I'm just not in doubt enough to, like, hold it up. but like, it was not it. I ran straight to the lemon store. I like, texted my friend who wears the lemon. I'm like, can I return this after I've worn it because, like, this is back and she's like, yeah, take it in. I took it in. got it to 2 strap thing cause I have one strap tops that are so cute, but they like, cut this way. I feel like the fact that it like goes one strap on one side and there's literally nothing on this side. it was not a win, you guys. it was not it for me. I was naked and I was about to fall out. so if you have a long torso and you're more flat chested, this is not for you."
0,"So I got the new large classic belt bag and my vision here was to use it as a gym bag. So I wanted to see if my gym shoes will actually fit in here or if it was a fail. This is the bag I'm currently using and there's nothing wrong with it. I just feel like I could definitely downsize cause literally the only things I bring to the gym are my AirPods and extra clip and my gym shoes. And then obviously I'm holding like my phone in my water bottle. So let's see if it works. So by the looks of it, it doesn't look like it's going to work the way I had planned. Um. I can fit one shoe or I can fit 2 and not be able to close it. So this was a fail. This will not be fitting my gym shoes. But it's so cute and massive and now I need to find something else to use it for. Accepting all serious suggestions."
-1,"Here's a Lululemon fail. I feel like I never post these, but I tried on these shorts, and I absolutely love them. Except they didn't have them in the size I wanted, so they were too big. But they were still kind of vibing, you know"
-1,"This is what happened to me. This is why. I don't drink protein shakes. I just ruined this. Ruined my floor. It's literally up my shirt, down my shirt. Whatever. My outfits ruined. My shirts ruined. What the hell?"
-1,okay can somebody help me out because unpopular opinion. I do not like these loop okay that cut me off but lululemon like what am I doing wrong because I went down a size like I was told to do and I got the alliance for my first pair and they're just not special at all like I would rather wear my Shein shean glow modes 10 to one and they're 23 these were 100 bucks what have I done wrong guys cause I'm willing to learn like somebody tell me if I've done something wrong did I get the wrong size did I get the wrong ones but they're not special okay but I can tell you that. I'm in love with this lululemon dupe and this came from Walmart it was like 9 so I hear that this is the dupe for the align um bra Slash tank and I'm loving it Walmart
0,come shopping with me. I'm a medium ish large ish fit in clothes. I love to work out but I also love wine let's see what's new at Lululemon that's me first the wonder train HR crop 23in 2 side drop pockets which I love this color is so cute for fall and the fabric is extra breathable the engineered warmth half step is so comfortable and so cute these thumbholes are perfection the wool blend fabric is so comfortable oh my god and there's a kangaroo zipper it goes all the way to the other side. I also paired this with the base Pei shorts that are reflective there's a back pocket overall very weightless. Lulu lost me with this wtf these are aligned rib waste crops these fits so weird. I feel like it's how maternity clothes fit in like the nineties when they didn't know how to make maternity clothes why does it get tighter towards my mid leg what do you guys think ah
0,"I don't even know what this outfit would be for or where I would wear it, but I just had to try it. I think the sleeves are super cool. It's, like, mesh all the way down. It has, like, these thumb holes, but it is a super comfy fabric. And it's mesh on the back. You can see my sports bra through it. I love this little puffy logo. I wish they would put it on other items. It's super cute. I think this one's gonna be a return for me, cause I literally would just have it sitting in my closet, but I got it in a size small. It comes in black. I think I would like the black, more tight fit lined long sleeve onesie, which I don't feel like it's that much of a tight fit. Like, there's a lot of, like, extra fabric, and I wish it unzipped farther. Like, stops right here, so it's kind of hard to get on and off. And it does zip all the way up if you like that."
0,"I have such high hopes for this dress, but this is probably the biggest fail. I think I got it too small of a size because it's tight on the hip, so I would need a size 6. This is a size 4. And then maybe you'll want to ride up and be weird and stick out these pockets just make it, like, fit kind of weird and just don't give you a good shape at all. But I'm gonna try it in the 6, cause I do really like the idea of this dress and how it is a little higher here, and then it cuts down and rounds, and then there's really good coverage in the back. It has, like, an open back. And the fabric is something I've never felt before. It's almost like the soft stream, just not as, like, silky. This one's more like textured. Kind of hard to describe. You'd have to feel it for yourself."
-1,"okay, so y'all know I love my lululemon. this top is reversible. I love her 10 out of 10. but what I don't love is their customer service. so if you've caught on lately,. I am obsessed with the groove pants. I have them, and I think 5 colors, and I just got this color in today. which is so cute. anyway, so I reached out to them because I had ordered a pair of groove pants they came in. I wore them for 15 minutes only to try on only to take them off to see that there was a legit hole in the butt. explain the whole situation to them, and this was the response that they gave me. not only did they not answer my question, they basically told me to wait until 2023 to get help. so I responded and said, how on earth does this help me, it responded back with, like, the same email. like, I've dealt with crappy customer service before. but I was not expecting this from them and I'm really upset. so I guess because they're putting a pause on helping people until 2023. I should put a pause on ordering from them until 2023. which, like, I really don't want to do. but, like, this is not okay. lululemon, please do better."
-1,"So do the question Ashley like um, after buddy thing commit for the videos honestly so just kind of fall down but whatever. Um, is your Uncle Lemon order so wait wait wait wait wait wait back. Um, so for the video because of a something extended aversion the belt bag. Okay, so the first one some of my eyes inclusive come personally. So anyways, you also see the large version apparently sick of Mary so we feed pretty much everyone so she's super excited. She just leave them in a bag of course it's the right thing but um, it's about only cause you know my honest reaction absorb she she probably the reviews I'm sorry she probably watch it reviews um, because they literally my honest reaction absorb so so about bag come cause use right now you see poor comparison so you get a large one just because you get stuff I carry around but yeah, so she got me super excited, you know. All right. Hopefully single eyes underwhelming can wait. Alright, hold on whoop. So the other go right now and it's because would y'all could come nah see eater last time you do that she literally back to the store because like my mom got wrong with all but say puddle consists it's a large one come see look look um, the extended large one. So I'm just extremely underwhelming and literally pretty tricky piece tight to come more regular one come little Mana Just think of search out the piece cake on stupid. He says it's a regular dish pulled usually. So the back falling off of it. Hold on. So she got linear but not your old controls at all. Not off. So that's upsetting."
-1,"Okay, can Lululemon stop with the thumbhole thing? Like, who is using that? Who finds that helpful? Who finds that useful? It just personally, in my opinion, gets in the way. It gives me, like, wears the wrong type of socks and 4th grade fever. Like, it just makes me feel awkward. Please, Lululemon for long sleeves. Skip. Just get rid of it. Please."
-1,okay guys this video is a lululemon video okay did you guys see what I did right there. I had to blur my address because you guys in here and TikTok will be crazy stalking no limit if you're watching this fix it so I went to the store the other day and just to see what they had in store you know I mean I really been wanting this um define jacket and I finally found a color that I love right so I got a define if you know you know it's not cheap and don't judge me it's cold in my apartment and this is a time to save the color. I like there that didn't have my size so we order online and it was gonna be fast shipping so I got it today right so as I'm trying it you know it's feeling all nice snug and then when I zipped up the zipper. I noticed this little imperfection you see how this side is like pulled don't pay attention to my nail. I'm due for them and it just looks uneven like with my OCD I know that's gonna bug this shit out of me because I know this shit wasn't cheap so my question to you guys what would you do well you just like I can live with it keep it or would you return it because of what you paid you know you at least want some something that is not gonna be defective and I know every time I look at it it's gonna bug the shit out of me so I think I'm gonna return it what do you guys think
-1,"Lululemon's just getting out of hand. Like, what were they thinking when they made these pants? There's really a line. High rise, mini flare. But who do these look good on? I really wanna know."
0,"Happy Monday everyone! Woke up at about 9 a. M. This morning and I was rotting in bed and on my couch for a hot minute before I decided to get up and make some breakfast. Then I decided. I should probably go move my body a little bit. So I went on a walk. And I decided to go pick up my Lululemon order. So I walked to the mall by my house. It was such a nice day out. Pretty chilly, but anyways,. I walked to Lululemon and got my Hemming order and walked home and then I realized they totally messed up my order. Look at those legs are so uneven! So I went back to Lululemon and they gave me a new pair because they don't make that color anymore. So that's just super awesome. But. And I got ready for work. I'm working mid shifts this week which is so nice. I haven't worked a mid shift in a while, so felt nice to get ready for work when it's still sunny outside. But I packed up my lunch. Had on my cute little Christmas outfit for work today. But I headed to Costco to get some gas before work. But guys, going to work when it's sunny out when you're used to working night shift. I was feeling all the serotonin. Okay, bye."

I'm obsessed already. This one is stocked full. So the first item is the groove flares. Nespresso give me every single thing in this color. That city state crew and these are gonna look so good together. And then this. I think is my favorite new item. I've switched from scubas to the scuba wine like pant. These are so so comfy. I need them in espresso. I need them in every color, but black is such a good neutral. They did actually already get a couple long sleeve all yours tees, but I got this one in black in a size 10. I think I got a size 8 in the ones before. I wanted more of like the oversized, especially in the arms, so we'll try that on.

I feel like my under eyes always look kind of dark and I also feel like it stays on when it gets on contouring when you don't want to do a whole bunch. I feel like it's a very good quick bronzer or quick. I hate this pencil but it just gives the perfect amount of coverage and I've already done my skincare. I don't know why we feel the need that we have to wear makeup to the gym after I'm done working out I go in the restroom and I get a towel.

I have to leave here in 15 minutes to make it to the gym on time and it really does lengthen my lashes the key to this lasting at the gym setting spray also.

-1,i'm gonna start this video by saying the salesperson that i just encountered at lululemon isn't that doing the devil's work yep there's no way in this world you should be so much in my mind that you persuade me to spend 900 on gym class he was doing voodoo yep however after i bought this stuff i said well hell i'll be damned if nobody sees me in these clothes so you all are about to see me try on all these outfits so here's the first thing i bought it's cute but not for one hundred and twenty eight dollars and not for ninety eight dollars here's the second outfit i bought i need to know what the hell type of material lululemon is using that they can charge these absurd prices for clothing what the hell here's the third outfit i got and you know what irritates me the most about all of this is that at this point i could have just paid to have my body done simple simple i'm buying all these clothes to go to the gym i could have just paid for a new body at this point and here's the final look i purchased and why the hell did i need this i don't know because i did it i look like a damn grape uh a two hundred dollar grape at that this is ridiculous uh

0,"The day is finally here. We're getting Easton haircut. Oh, I'm scared. Are you ready? Alrighty, Queens, how are we feeling? Are we excited? Are we nervous? Because I'm feeling a little nervous, but I have good vibes. I'm trying a new place. Queens, it's just you and I, actually. Easton second haircut. His first was so bad, you guys, I'm not even exaggerating. It was not a fun experience whatsoever. Pretty much got a butcher haircut. And the girl doing his hair was so not nice. Especially for being his first. We're going to a whole new place today, which I'm so excited about. I feel like I'm sweating already. First, we're gonna go get some Boba. I kind of want to try a new flavor. I also love my tried and true, which is a blended Vietnamese coffee with Boba. Well, I gotta go. They just let me know that I could pick up on this. What are you singing? We just pulled up. Let's go get some Boba. Yo, Ace is having a panic attack. Are those tears? Oh, come on, let's go get some Boba. You nervous about your haircut? No stroller because he's a big boy. Hi, how are you? Hi, Ashley. No, y'all tell me. Everyone okay? Yeah. Let me try it. I don't know. He's such a big boy. Here's my drink. You got a strawberry and mango blended with tapioca in it. So let's try it together. A dub. If it's not Coffee. Easton can have some of this. MMM. Oh, yeah, that's good. Oh, gosh. So good. Let's have Ethan try it. Make sure not to give him any of the balls. Oh, yeah, he likes it. It's so good. It's fire. Bye, guys. I'll see you next time. Oh, that flavor was actually so delicious. I'm shocked, actually. I've been loving trying all these new flavors. Look at me, getting outside the box. You want more? Bye, Angels. Loki, spill some Boba on the way out. It's okay. We're gonna be right on time to his haircut. This texture of the tapioca is just delicious. 10 times. Hey, guys. We just pulled out. Hopefully Ethan doesn't cry, because last time he did cry, the only one to calm him down was Cody. And it's just me today, so good. Without further ado, no stroller again. I love her. I think he's tired. Good. How are you? This is your spot right here, baby. I know the second one. Oh, my god. Oh, my goodness me a morning. I love him so much. He looks stunning. Glasses for the. I'm sorry, who is that big boy? He looks so freaking cute. I'm obsessed. I love it. The experience was 1010. She was so incredibly nice. She actually spoke Spanish, too, so we were just talking and laughing. Easton did amazing. I'm so happy we found our new haircut place. Love that you guys are here for all the big moments. And The small ones. I love you guys. Bye."

I have been procrastinating the grocery store for so long. I got a little pick me up. See if I can open this. I used to get so scared of these when I was little. Maybe even now a little bit. I get my nails done tomorrow. Cutie straw. Of course. Cheers. The grocery store is normally very therapeutic for me, but since I know I have so much stuff to buy,. I'm, like, overwhelmed. That's why we're going it together. Exactly what I needed. I want to go to Trader Joe as well, but I don't know if we're gonna have time to do all that. We'll see. If not, we'll go tomorrow. Let's go and see what else we get into. You watch the show with the weekend in it? Idle. Definitely do not watch with your kids or your mom. Really good. I'm kind of into it. It's called the idle.

They got jumbo blueberries, and they kind of scare me. I like your outfit, baby. These mandarins are so good. We need to go get up. This is what I eat every Single day. Probably twice a day. One thing about me is I love me a good little rocks. Hussy. Yeah. They're out of croissants. Do you know the muffin man? Okay, we're gonna get muffins instead. This is one of my favorite salads. Grapes. Fun fact, my mom's favorite fruit was kiwi. She used to eat it every morning on an empty stomach to help with her digestion. I don't know. These spoons for Easton. Have a kissy. Mwah. Thank you. I used to only eat rice before I met Cody. And Cody only eats tortillas. He'll eat rice occasionally, but he's a big tortilla boy. He's Mexican bacon. Oh, you know what I'm craving? So I actually lived in Thailand for, like, 4 months, and I loved their mango sticky rice. Even though I don't like mango,. I like the mango sticky rice, and I feel like we should go get that very soon, if not today. Prep your mama orange juice for Cody. My toxic trade is thinking. I don't need to make a list for groceries and then forgetting quite literally everything. Being on the cottage cheese bandwagon. We're gonna try it. Whites. These are my favorite eggs. And I get these. My mom used to buy these. I love this brand called Cocokind. We're here to. What are you doing? Sucking your thumbs to check out. Doing. There's a. We did it! We did our big, massive shopping haul. I used to always buy my mom Flowers from here? Now I got nobody to buy flowers for. AC blasting groceries are done. Wish we could go get some Boba right now, but I gotta go drop these groceries off. Tomorrow, you and I. I love you guys. Toodles."

I got a size 6 in this so it's more fitted but it fits so well I love it and then my current favorite bras from lululemon is the align bra so I got this one.

And we headed to Magic Kingdom, even though my outfit is actually themed for a ride at Hollywood Studios,. Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway. We did Tron today, which was so cool. I always love this ride. And then we had new releases at Lululemon. Thanks to everyone who joined my live stream. The mini Mike made a comeback. And look who we found. It's Jillian. You might know Jillian from our live stream. She's always in the chat. So we did some rides with Jillian and then we headed to the Diamond Horseshoe for our dinner reservation. This meal is so good. It's the same as Liberty Tree Tavern, which we tried last time. And I actually remember this place as a kid. But it was quick service and there was like a show. Does anyone else remember that from the nineties? Then we had to get this guest dining bracelet so that they would usher us out of the park because it was the Nikki's not so scary Halloween party at Magic Kingdom. So we hopped over to Epcot. We did Soarin and watched dancing with the stars."

1,"time for a Lululemon Black Friday haul. I did so much damage. so where my parents live, there's actually a Lululemon outlet. and the outlet is always my favorite place to go. and then it was already Black Friday. I knew the deals are gonna be so good. because I've gone for years. and the past. and let me tell you. I got some goods. so the first thing that I got is probably my favorite thing. it is this free to be bra and I have one of these, and I am obsessed with them. they're so cute. the back is adorable. and I already wore it. so there's a little bit of self tan. we're just gonna ignore that. but anyways,. I don't know the name of this color. but when I saw it,. I just had to get it. I got mine in a size 6. they do run a little small because I would typically say that my lululemon size is about a 4 in bras and bottoms. but these ones,. I would definitely say run small. and I got this for such a good price. this was 21. so I get an extra 15 off because I'm part of the military and first responders discount that you get that little 15. but these without the discount were 24. the next thing I got was definitely, like,. I saw it was there, and I was like,. I need to get these. these are the align short and they're in the 8in. I personally like the 8in. their high rise, obviously, they're a little out there. okay. they're wild. but I love wearing wild prints and bright colors to the gym. so these, these did it for me. and together, these were so cute. so these were also 24. and then I got 15 off on top. but even before the, um, lululemon outlet discount. they were 49, so still a great deal. but I actually got these for so cheap and they're originally 64 bucks, so definitely got a great price. this next item. I was pretty surprised to see at the outlet. it is a black lululemon aligned bra. and it's reversible. it has the camo print on the other side. and I do have camo and black aligned, so I had to, and so these were originally 58. and then at the outlet price, they were 39. and then they were on sale for 24. so I got it for so cheap and it was just so cute. I couldn't pass it up. I also have one of these bras. I'd say these fit pretty true to size. these are also way more supportive than the other bra. but yeah, they are the aligned bras. and most of them are reversible. so I would definitely give them a try if you haven't already. they are so cute. and I love how open the back is. and last but not least, my boyfriend doesn't have TikTok, so I'm gonna show you guys one of the Christmas gifts I got him. this is the men's metal vent tech half zip, and it's originally 98, and I got it for 41. and I love this color. he is a huge Miami Dolphins fan, so this teal was just so nice. and I got him in an extra large for him. he is 6ft 4 and 220 for reference safe to say it was a gray haul"

1,"You love Lululemon like me. You need to listen up. Today I'm gonna show you some must haves from Lululemon if you're trying to build your workout wardrobe. So the most important thing is a basic pair of leggings. These are the Wonder Train leggings. I recommend either buying these or the aligned leggings. They're both super comfy, super durable, and are great for any workout. These are also a necessity for the fall and winter when you just wanna have a comfy outfit on and put on some leggings. Next is the aligned short. These shorts are perfect for lounging around and even for wearing to the gym. The next thing you need is a supportive bra for cardio and working out. This is the Energy Bra, long line. This is a bra that supports me the most and I love it. This is what it looks like on. This bra is perfect for all types of cardio and I wear almost every time I run. Last but not least, my favorite item, the fast and free short. These are my favorite running shorts ever. They're even a perfect everyday short. So there's my guideline of buying from Lululemon if you're a newbie or if you just wanna build a better workout wardrobe. Comment down below if you have any questions. Bye!"
1,"this is one of my favorite versatile shirts from lululemon. I got it in black the other day. let's unbox the white opal one. I was debating getting creamy mint, but, like, white. and, like, the white opal and black are just so easy to pair with a lot of things. so this is the time to restore in nulu long sleeve. I sized up to a 12 in this. and this is one of those shirts that you easily can throw on with, like, a pair of booties and jeans or leggings and it just be super cute outfit will try this on because I literally waited so long for white opal to go on mark down as well as the black one. but let's try this on. okay, so here's just one way that I would style this. like, you literally cannot tell this is from lulu. and this is, like, the most comfortable shirt ever. and again, it has the crisscross in the front. I will show you the back but look at how cute these shoes look with it. I am obsessed. and here we have the little back action. love."

1,"Little shopping after my shift. Let me show you what I got. We have the 6in align shorts in Utility Blue. I grab these in the same size as my leggings, which is an 8. And then these are the 6in aligned shorts. This color is stunning. I'm obsessed at the align waist length racerback tank. This is the high neck one entitled Teal. I size up to a 12 in this because of that new loo fabric. This color is also blue and beautiful. I'm on a blue roll, as we all know. I love blue. This is so cute. I figured this would be perfect for hot yoga. Let's try them on. Okay, so I light up over there so it's not too dark, but here is the tank. I love this so much. It looks so good with navy. And here is the back. It's gonna be such a perfect hot yoga tank. Let's try on the shorts. And here are the 6in align shorts. This color is everything. I am obsessed. Love these.

1,we will in the lemon hole it's a small one but we're gonna do it so let's open it together this is from we make too much just saying a couple pieces let me show you what I got two pairs of leggings we're into these ones first because i've had my eye on these since my obsession started and one of these forever i waited until i want to mark down they are so pretty these are the aligned pants and the twenty five inch in the everglade green and the scuba in this color and I absolutely love it they feel like silkier more dry fittier than normal if that makes sense but cute and then the other pair I got is the farber small tie aligned leggings in the 28 inch which I cannot believe these went on marked down so fast like I feel like this come this pattern literally just launched but like how do you say no to these so cute that's it that was the smallest unboxing. I feel like I've ever done so we have more than enough time to try these on okay so here the everglade green alliance is it just me or like do these feel different obviously you can't tell because you're not here feeling but if you snagged these and we made too much or you just have them tell me if you feel this okay or if I'm crazy okay and here the farmer small tie obviously this isn't the jam. I'm not a big pattern gal. I was wearing a pattern shirt for leggings besides like camo because that's just like a basic you need that but I just love this pattern so I had to snake these. I love them adding two words to my collection absolutely love them happy with them content you can chop these and anything and everything lululemon linked to my bio

1,welcome to my skins versus lululemon comparison i am literally obsessed with all yours tees and everything from skins now from the boyfriend collection and of course the under e is five inch lululemon underwear so i kind of wanted to just feel like a little brief comparison like price feel the vibe okay so starting with this is the skims boyfriend collection obviously the shorts are a little see through but like mind you they're like not for like wearing out and about they're literally like underwear okay and this shirt is a little see through too and like I said it is like made for laundry so like not wearing a public but I am definitely going to be wearing these shirts out. I am so obsessed if you remember my first skin like review when I opened this. I like was literally flabbergasted because it is so soft. I'm gonna find like what the shirt is made of and put it in the comments like you can see but like honestly the only wait that cut me off because my phone's about to die the only way to really like understand is to feel it. I'm just so obsessed and this is the medium when I reordered more. I did size up to the large so I'm actually gonna throw on a large quick even though it's not a matching size just so you can see the difference and then we're gonna do the lululemon okay and then here's the size large in the shirt from skims. I would say that like a large would be for like me personally comparable to a size eight and all yours see from Lulu last thing about skims that we're gonna turn the Lululemon of course like I'm never gonna get over how like cute the low going is on here love they're so soft a must okay and then we have it all yours t which I am obsessed with. I literally wear every single day and like the skims is for lounging and like obviously this is just like you can wear out about you can wear outside of the house. I love that part of these and then I also feel like the lululemon ones are longer and they do have a logo on the back of one of the legs. I remember correctly so I'm gonna compare the two and then do the prices quick okay so they both have like the underwear vibe with the lines and then the Lulu logo is cute and on the back of here here's that skims logo. I was talking about honestly. I couldn't pick a favor. I literally love them both these are just a little softer so the last little comparison I'm gonna do is just the price real quick the little lemon ones are 28 for the underwear and the skims are 26 the all years t is 58 and the skims t is 48 and be sure to shop all you lululemon faves in the link in my bio it supports me. I would honestly recommend both items from both. I am obsessed with them all and you can check out my bio for more
1,"I have never been more excited to open a package. I have been holding off on getting this color for far too long. Only did we get something in Java. We got a set. We got the align short in Java, got the like a cloud bra in Java. Let's try these babies on. Don't freak out, because I think I did enough of that for all of us. I cannot get over how good this is. Before reference, because I always got to let you know. I got an 8 in the bra. Like a cloud always runs a little bit smaller on me. I usually get a 4 in a lines, but I tried the 6 and I kind of think I like them a little bit better."

I can throw a Jean jacket on which planning on wearing tomorrow with just pair of leggings and like a cute pair of booties so super easy outfit super versatile let's try this on okay so here it is again one of those pieces that you can literally wear with everything. I got this in a size 6. I'm gonna show you with a Jean jacket on a flannel and a cardigan so here is the Jean jacket here it is with a jacket here is a cardigan so as you can see this shirt is very versatile you can literally wear it with so much.

1,"part 2 of how I Became a Lululemon Ambassador. so if you're here for part one, we're right about the end of 2021. we're building a relationship with the store, and things are going super well. educators, the key leaders, the store managers, are really starting to become friends at this point. supporting them, they're supporting me, and it feels like this really good relationship. at the end of the day, that's what the store ambassadors are for. store ambassadors are meant to promote community, support the store, be great representations of the brand. the first few months of 2022, we did 1t together. we got to do a few events. we took a bunch of spin classes. mo, Dave, Katie loved it all. and then we got to May, 2022. well, actually, let's backtrack one SEC. in February of 2022,. I wrote down on a giant piece of paper that hung on my wall for the entire year. I will be a Lululemon ambassador. so now let's go to May. and they asked me to be their store ambassador, and it was a surreal moment. you know, it wasn't just surreal because Lululemon is a very recognizable brand, and I love their stuff so much. I've been wearing it for, like, 12 years. it's because it was a symbol of all of the work and the effort that I had put into this community. and fostering this community and creating these relationships for the last 5 years was truly just like the cherry on top of really finding and figuring out what my purpose was. my purpose is to create connection and create community through a yoga practice, but also now, through this brand. now that's what I get to do. not as how I became a store ambassador for Lululemon. now, if you wanna hear more about what a store ambassador actually does, what that means, go ahead and like this video, and maybe I'll do a part 3."
0,"It's time for another Lululemon unboxing. Wow. Oh, my God. Wow. Ha ha. I wasn't expecting that. Ha ha."
0,"I'm finally getting around to answering this question. how did I become a lululemon ambassador? so about 5 years ago,. I started as a yoga instructor in the San Diego community. when I first started teaching yoga,. I knew I wanted to be different, be a leader in the community like I was a leader in my other career that I had at the time. more so than that,. I wanted to create a really inspiring experience for my students. and so I took my job super seriously. I spent hours preparing for every class that I taught. now, shit happens, and some people just aren't gonna love your style, but for the most part,. I fostered some really strong relationships with my students. and over the years, especially through Covid, people started to notice the difference that I was making. not gonna lie, felt really good. felt good to know that I was actually making a difference in people's lives. actually being able to influence someone from when they first walked into my room to when they left the room, that's all I could have ever asked for as a teacher. so now we're at, like, the end of 2019. no, sorry. I'm, like, really giving you all the details here. and in 2019,. I met a store ambassador named Francis, and Francis is actually now my co ambassador for La Jolla in San Diego. and I connected so much,. I really felt like I found somebody who got it understood. what I was trying to do, because he was doing the same thing within his own community. once Francis and I continued to connect, he started to realize this impact that I was making. world of Lululemon, in their specific communities, is very small. people are connected, and people share experiences. so when Francis had started to share his experiences with me, with his store, they wanted to connect. so we're now about the end of 2021. doing different events with Lululemon. I'm getting even more involved in the community, and I'm specifically connecting with the store leaders in La Jolla. the educators and the key leaders, and the store managers were all instructors in the area, and it was super fun. I was taking a bunch of classes with them and really just getting to know them. I started spending a lot of time with that store. they really just started to become friends, and we developed this natural relationship with each other. they would support me, and I would support them. and we're already getting to the end of this video, so I'm gonna have to go with a part 2."
1,"Got a little in store pick up. Let's see what I got. The 4in Heathered for Ultra, like Ray Lounge full shorts. I love these. These are actually sold out online,. I think in pretty much every size. I love these so much. I'm gonna try them on for you. I know I already posted a try on of these, but I have to try these on for you. They are so adorable and they look so good with my love long sleeves. All right, let's do the try on. Okay, so here they are. Look at how freaking cute these are. These are so comfortable. They're just so plushie and just like a perfect lounge short. I love these. 10 out of 10 recommend these shorts.

0,"Come work out with me, a varsity athlete who literally hates lifting weights. Ever since I started running,. I've had absolutely no interest in the gym, but we're gonna try it out today. I always start with a little walk and stretch, which is probably my favorite part of the whole thing. I started off with squats. Just super lightweight, really focusing on my form and taking it nice and slow. This honestly had me so humbled, because even with the tens,. I was feeling it. And there's me with my new water bottle. Here's some more squats. This is probably one of my favorite exercises at the gym because I just feel so cool when I do it. Next, I did some banded pull UPS. Again, this humbled me so bad, and I literally feel so weak now. I need to go to the gym more. Next, I did this cable thing. I can't even remember what it's called, but my boyfriend was doing it, so I just copied him. Next, I did these single kneeling overhead press. I think that's what it's called. Once again, this was, like, so demotivating, because this is way less sweet than I was doing in the fall. But it's okay. I haven't felt like going to the gym in so long. So even though this weight isn't what I'd be hoping to do,. I'm so proud of myself for going to the gym. I know that there's lots of room for improvement. In the fall. Finally, I just finished with some stretching. Overall, this was not a great workout for me. I felt super weak. But I know that's because I haven't been in the gym, and I've just been focusing on running, which is okay. At least I know where my strength levels are at, so I can be ready for the fall to improve and work really hard. And that's it. Bye, guys."

1,"So I'm getting ready to go teach a couple classes at Bar 3 and I wanna wear what's in here. I totally forgot. I had not unboxed it yet. So this is from the outlet hall I did in Niagara. Prosecco Align Pants. I have not been able to get my hands on these ever since they sunset this color. I wish I could still get the align tank, but at the moment I got the align pants. This I believe is what color is this? Heathered pink peony. But it kind of goes in my pajamas because it's minus 3 Celsius outside right now. And here's the fit. Gonna pair this with the scuba half zip. Also pink peony puff carry socks. Shade TV collab. I think this is so cute. Pomegranate a line tank plus maybe relevant coat. And these are some Sperry boots. Lululemon, I hope you make boots. And lastly, the Wineberry Quilted. Allure everywhere belt bag. Let's go."

The countdown is on and don't worry, we don't have to be fully packed by the first because we actually have the whole month to move in and official move in date is not until halfway through the month. So keep following along because this is gonna be a long journey. Today we filmed for some sponsored content. You may have already seen my Fab Pit fun video up, but we've also got a Lululemon video coming your way. I also got my first final in the mail today. Taylor Swift 1989,. Taylor's version. Then tonight we went on live stream to make friendship bracelets. This is for my TikTok live subs. And after we made some bracelets, yes, we made more because some got stolen in the mail, we decided to make my Halloween costume. More videos coming out on this. Did you watch my live stream? I'll see you tomorrow."
1,"hey, guys. so I just wanted to pop on here really quickly. so if you're like me,. I tend to leave items sitting in my Lulu cart for weeks. um, so if you have either of these items in your cart, this is your sign to get them. this is the align mock neck long sleeve shirt. it's so good. so I bought true to size 6 for me. um, I'm gonna have to get it in every color. now. it's so soft, so comfortable. literally, it's a line leggings in a shirt. it's so good. and then this is the Wonder Puff vest. I size down to a 4 in it. I love it. I love the length. I love everything about it. and these 2 items together. so good."
0,"We're at the first lululemon restaurant, and we're gonna take you along to show you what we got. So they actually set people down right below the store where you can go inside and shop all you eat. The first thing we ordered is this bread with some olive oil. I got the pane pasta with hot Italian sausage and tomato cream sauce. I got a seafood dish that has shrimp, scallops, crab cake and a corn sauce. And I got a three meat bolognese with cheese tortellini and a side of a lactate pill. So I'm gonna rate my meal a seven out of ten. The seafood definitely didn't taste that fresh, but overall it was very good. I rate this an eight out of ten. My pasta was... OK, so I rate my meal eight out of ten, just because it was really good, but the portions were like a kid sized."

-1,"Y'all, I am literally so mad right now. So I put an order in for pretty little things for my vacation that's coming up. And let me show y'all, you know, cause normally companies, when they are like, oh, 2 X, it doesn't actually fit like a 2 X. And I got these in a 2 X because I'm plus size, but these are plus plus size. Who the. Who can fit in this and be so fucking for real because they still don't fit. Hold on, hold on, hold on. So I got this bodysuit, Bam! 2 X. Not wearing it. I don't know. I know I didn't lose no weight, but y'all get this. So I ordered this, this set. First of all,. I just wanna say, I hate that everything comes separate. These biggest. Who's gonna wear these? Can these even fit? Will my butt even fit into these? As a woman that has boobs but no butt, that's a whole lot of back that's gonna fit back there then, right? I got the skirt in the top to match. Don't get me wrong, all of these are very, very, very, very, very, very cute. But why couldn't y'all tell me that they actually ran big? Y'all, y'all, y'all. Who's gonna wear this? Who, who, who, who, who, who? And the rest of my stuff isn't even here yet. And it says it's delivered. I'm blue."
-1,"Little thing dress, but it does not fit anywhere like I expected. It looks so good on the model. I feel like with websites like this, it's either gonna be hit or miss. Normally I get, like, sweatpants, sweatshirts from them, love them all, but the dresses. I don't know about. They are very short in the back. I need a little bit more fabric. The side slits are kind of cutting it close for me with being too low where I can't wear the high rise thongs I want to wear. The cheap wire just doesn't really do much for me whatsoever. So this one's gonna be returned, and I'm very disappointed because it looked so good online. I know you guys are not gonna believe me with how bad this looks, but this did look really good online. Looks like I'm wearing, like, red linen or pillowcase or something. I don't know. Maybe. But this is way too short, and it's just not good. So don't waste your money on this one."

I mean, when doesn't she look great? Here's another photo of her just looking absolutely stunning. This dress is so gorgeous. Next up, we have India from Love Island. I'm liking this. I think she is so cool. Has the coolest style. She's so stunning. I'm just obsessed. Next we have Jasmine Tukes. I like this.

She looks so gorgeous. Next up is Sassy Baby. I will always call her sassy baby, no matter what anyone says. I like this, but, like, it's giving, like,. Fashion Nova going to the club, college girl. I mean, it's fine. It's a pretty little thing show, but just not my fave. Same with Lala Anthony. It's cute. I like the mesh. I like it all, but I feel like she's in college going to the club. Although her hair and makeup is a slay. Miss Molly Mae. I mean, I'm obsessed with literally everything she does. Love this so much. I'm Rada. Looking amazing as always. I love the color of this. I love the sheer. I think she looks amazing. This is a little more mature than the other two outfits. For me, I feel like,. I don't know,. Cindy Kimberly slay. I mean, she always slays, but obsessed. Lori Harvey. Oh my god, I absolutely love this look. From the dress to the gloves to the jewels to the hair and makeup, she looks amazing.

Cocoa Jones stunning as always. I literally thought this was Jennifer Hudson at first. Like, I think they are actually twins, but she looks amazing. Last but not least, we have Winnie Harlow looking amazing as always. I mean, this is a little better than Julia Fox. Like, at least she's covered a little more. I love the coat. She just looks amazing. I feel like the theme of the night was where the least amount of clothes is you possibly can."

I literally was rushing out but I got back home around two in the morning and I said let me try it on so this is what it looks like absolutely love the top and the skirt. I had to squeeze the zip up to that point. I could probably force it but I'm scared that if I sit down it will split yeah I'm scared that once I sit down or split so I just thought rather than trying to do risque that I should literally just return it and get it in a bigger size if I really and truly like it and if I don't then don't get it but to be honest with you. I wanna know what you lot's opinion is that little flap droop draper whatever they call it droop thingy do you really think it is needed if it's up to me yeah if I can see where it is attached. I'm actually gonna cut it off because I find it very awkward

I love the style,. I love the colour. and then also I have this shirt as well. I was thinking of undoing the buttons and then tying it. did it. did you get my vibe?

I've got some, like, really nice pink heels and I'm gonna do a try on. so follow me if you wanna see it. like this video, comment on it."

Was very kind of gifted, but I'm obsessed. First of all, look at this outfit I've got on. If you followed me last year, you will know these are all I lived in. I literally love them. It's like these oversized, like, boyfriend shorts and it's, like, oversized jacket. I love them. I do sometimes wear the jacket, like zip dye. That was what I was looking for, um, with, like, little crop tops and stuff. But it's freezing outside, so this is how we've been wearing it today. I just love them. I love that the shorts aren't too short as well. Just me. This is literally me all summer long and then quickly. Can we take a minute for this bag? I got this bag to go with this outfit. I don't know, it's giving me, like, sport vibes, and I'm very sporty and I definitely need to go to the gym when I finish uni this summer, but it's giving me, like, sporty Y2K bags. I'm obsessed with this bag. It's, like, rushed, and you can, like, rush it even more. Like it's got, you know, like, them drawstrings at the back. But I don't know. This is something really cool about this. It did come in another colour. What? I believe Was cream, but I thought that like darker colour went with this outfit better. And then have I got the cord that we all need for spring. Firstly is this like oversized shirt. I don't even know what this pattern is. I feel like it's marble, but I'm obsessed with it. It's like a sheer oversized shirt, but it's not too sheer. Like it's not mesh, if that makes sense. And I just love this. This is gonna go with so many things. Could even be like a beach cover up. Love. But the trousers. Look at the wide leg trousers as well. I'm obsessed. I got the trousers in a size 12 and the shirt for tanks. I wanted to be oversized. Not gonna try this on for you guys today. Those you are gonna have to stick around and even see the vlogs. I'm gonna wear this to a bottomless brunch. Or you can check out my Instagram of the photos will be up next week. But I'm obsessed. Thank you so much. PLT for all of items and I hope you enjoyed. If you wanna see the 2 piece style, do let me know. And of course we'll do a video on it. I do a video on styling this. But I think we all know how I'm gonna style. I'm gonna style it with a pair of white trainers and that little bag."
0,just a reminder that this is what a blazer looks like when it's been mass produced and made by garment workers that aren't paid enough and aren't treated well and this is what a blazer looks like when it's an original design and it's been lovingly made by garment workers who are paid well and is part of a small business who cares about longevity it's a no brainer who I'd rather support

They're brand new pretty little thing dresses. I've never worn them out yet, but I did buy them last year. I think I'm gonna go for this black one and then a black blazer, but I'm not hundred percent sure cause the weather is beautiful right now. So got leave in like half an hour. Done my makeup, done my hair. Can we just take a moment to appreciate this dress? I'm obsessed with it. Definitely the right choice. I prefer this to the other one. I've had two. And fold down my bra straps cause I can't find my um, big tube up bra right now. But it just didn't look right with obviously the straps or. I'm obsessed with this. I think I'm gonna just wear it with my converse cause I'm not really feeling heels. And then this blazer, which I'm gonna take, but I don't really fancy wearing it right now cause the weather is beautiful. But yes, this my outfit. I'm just gonna put some jewelry on. So I just had to take that face off cause it's so warm. But these are the converse I'm gonna pair it with. Um. They do need a really good clean, so I'm gonna get a baby wipe on them right now. So I've just popped This converse on with it, it doesn't look too bad, to be fair. I just thought the pink with this vibe wasn't really a vibe, but I like it. And I've just popped on some jewelry. I was debating whether to wear a necklace, but it's really not the dress for a necklace,. I don't think. And I've just got my guest little bracelet,. Pandora ring clattering. And then my other two go to bracelets. And then the bag that I'm gonna pair it with is just this black one from Shein. And that is my outfit done. I'm just gonna have a spritz of this body fragrance as well. Put that everywhere. And then I spray some actual perfume, and then I'm good to go. But I'm obsessed with this outfit. How cute."

1,"Get in here. I went shopping, so. I have some pieces I want to try on with you guys today. I'm really excited about. They're all from different places like Amazon, pretty little thing, yada, yada, yada. Let's just get into it. This is a top I got from Amazon. Super cute, super stretchy, thick material, good quality, 20. Love it. Next. I love how they fit. I always have a problem where, like, jeans will fit me down below, but the waist will be too big. These are perfect. Perfect. Stretchy, comfortable. The color is really good for the summer, but also, if you had a girl and you got that sauce, you could also make this color work for the fall. Those who got it, got it. You know, they. Don't be mad at me. I'm just the messenger. Before I back up from this camera and show y'all this piece,. I just want you to know that this piece right here is the reason why I did this whole little try on haul. This is one piece that I wanted to show y'all. Girl,. I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'm showing up when I wear this skirt. This skirt is from Prettylittlething. It's a UK 8, and. I'm speechless. It's not too stretchy, but it's like the perfect amount of stress. The skirt is really giving. Red carpet movie premiere. Like, be so serious. Be serious. I don't have a red carpet to Work here in Miami just yet. But I'm manifesting it, okay? For the girls who understand or who go through this trouble. But, like, when you want a big body, sometimes it comes with potholes, and I don't really like when my cellulite shows like that. So the fact that this skirt does not show my cellulite, and the color is really light, pretty little thing snapped with this one. And I'm just gonna be honest with y'all. That's it. That's all the pieces I had. I really did this whole try on haul just to show you guys this piece. If you ask me, it was worth it."
-1,"Right. Because if there was one thing that was gonna send me over the edge, it was gonna be a pretty little thing. Order. Right. I know my bedroom is a mess. Don't. Don't. Don't come at me, but I ordered two skirts, a T-shirt, and a coat. Right. First of all, the coat would even fit Eli, right? So I don't know what kind of size 16 that is, but it ain't my size 16. Second of all,. I thought, I'll buy a maxi skirt because I've got a fit idea in my mind. What in the BFG is going on with this skirt? Right? Let me just back up, because what in the Big Friendly Giant is going on? Like, it's under my chin. It's practically touching my eyebrows. I thought it's roost, so I'm gonna need to roost up the size to make it smaller. No, no, it was just roost up the sides and the front and the back was still weird back there. Like, what in the curtain? I could hang that up as a curtain. Because she must have been 8 foot to be sewing this piece of fabric together. Pretty little thing. Need to sort the hell out because the things are either too small or too rough cut. Long, big. Like, that is me in a skirt. I'm. I'm confused. I'm so confused. I've spent more time ordering and sending back than I've actually bought, like, enjoyed the clothes. They need to Try it out. Because it's just pissed me off cause who is that gonna fit? It's not because I'm small, it's because that is made for BFG's wife. Because what is going on? That is not a normal person. That is not the height of a normal person. Um, like, waist down"
1,"Hi everyone. So a prettylittlething has officially launched their girls versus cancer swimwear collection. So prettylittlething was kind enough to gift me some of the items and obviously this is something close and personal to me, with me obviously being a cancer survivor, so PLT has made this range post surgery friendly. And also PLT will be donating 100 of the profit to girls versus cancer. So like I said, this is also something that's quite personal and close to me and so, yeah, just appreciate being a part of it really. So yeah, just thought I'd share some of the pictures. So they sent me the stuff and I chose obviously what I wanted. If I'm on a surprise, even really remember what I chose. And this is quite handy actually, because I literally don't my own any swimwear whatsoever, so I'm excited. So if I remember rightly, this is a bikini and then like a little like, skirt to match. So these are the bottoms of the ones that you can like, tie at the side yourself, which are always useful. And then this is the top, so. So that bit goes like round your neck, then that bit goes to the back. Is literally such a nice colour as well. It's like a yellowy green type colour. Yeah. And then this is like a little like, cover up skirt. Uh, go with it. It's so cute. And then I also just chose this blue set as well. So I think it's again, if I remember rightly, so obviously things like a bikini and like a little cover up skirt. So this is gonna be a bit, like, difficult show cause it's all, like, undone. But, um, that's the bikini top. The bottoms are all undone as well. So this is gonna be quite hard to show you. But these are the bottoms again, they're the ones that, like, you tie at the side yourself, so you can have them as tight or as loose as you want, I suppose. And then this is obviously the skirt. So this one is actually a longer skirt, which I think is really nice, actually. But yeah,. I just love how, like,. PLT has just made them still, like, nice. Know me? Like, you still gonna feel nice wearing them. So, yeah. Thank you so much, PLT, for the swimwear."
1,"P L T have come out with the nicest skims dupes and I'm so impressed with the quality and the price. So if you're looking for like the H M, it's always sold out. Don't walk run to P L T. Because honestly the versatility I have for this collection. Incredible. Let's unbox it! So I saw this a while ago and I ordered a top and I have had so many compliments on the top. I'll insert a picture of what it looks like because honestly it's the most flattering top ever. Then Madison Sarah posted this and the top started going viral. This quality is like literally a Duke for skims. If not, I think it might even be better. It's a third of the price and obviously cause Madison Sarah got it,. I had to get it as well. They do like seven or eight different colours in this top. They do sizes all the way from like a 4 to like a 20. I think. And just look how nice that is. Then decided to pick up a pair of the leggings. These literally are like Lululemon dupes. I'm not even joking. They feel exactly the same. Great quality, thick. Now I love that they do plus size and they do petite as well and I'm a petite girly so I picked up a pair of these brand new. Like waist ones like this. Absolutely love. And black leggings in a size 6. Obviously this looks Absolutely tiny right now, but trust me, they've got a good bit of stretch to them cause we wanna suck me in. Yes. I got two parcels left. So the next thing I picked up was actually a long sleeve version of the first top, but not high neck, in this gorgeous grey khaki brown colour. Look at that, it is cropped as well, but how gorgeous. Again, that really nice material. Got this in a size 6. It's not as fitted as the other T-shirt, but I reckon when I put it on, it will be the last thing I got from that collection is actually an all in one. Now these are obviously ideal for autumn, but I got this petite in a size 6. So it's leggings all in one, but with a little bit of strapiness that could easily be worn elsewhere. And it's not super, super long. So for my girlies that I like 5 3 and under, this could be perfect for you cause I'm 5 2 and this is literally like the perfect length for me. What are you gonna be picking up from this collection?"
1,this may come off as very dramatic but I just found the best pair of sweatshorts let me know why my camera quality is like an iphone four anyways. I'm talking better than soffee shorts if you know you know better than brandy melville and dare I say it better than aritzia and the icing on the cake they are 10 they are from pretty little thing and they are the sweat pocket short they look like on they're the perfect length they have an elastic waistband can roll them they have pockets they're loose they're soft you don't feel restricted you don't feel exposed they are just perfect in all aspects I got them in five colors this one is the gray marl this is the baby pink these are stone and these are chocolate they're perfect 10 this is even sponsor. I just want to share
1,"Okay, I got the dress. I wanted to see what it looks like on my body type. I got a UK size 12. I thought it might be small, so let's see how it looks on. I mean, it's pretty cute. I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty flattering. It's a little weird when I turn to the side here, but I actually really like it. I think it's really cute. Okay."
1,stop scrolling if you've got one of these dresses because I kid you not trying on holiday clothes but oh I think I've done something good here so obviously this is how you wear the dress right crossover at the front little moment at the back but what if I told you you could wear this dress backwards like you'd think that sounds really stupid wouldn't ya but if you swing this bit round and wear this bit up here swing these up. I think we've done some good here. I'm gonna show you hold on right so the dress is on back to front obviously you can see the back that's what's meant to be the front these are meant to go around and cross over but so I've got it on back to front now let me just tuck the tag in and then these bits what if I told ya you could just bring them up here so let me just tie it and I'm not being funny but hold on we've got a new dress here two in one. Im actually. Oh I love it

0,"Oh,. I never thought the day would come, but the day has come. I would just like to preface this video by saying. I didn't pay for any of this. I happen to know the PR Girl and Pretty Little Thing, and I decided I would like to give some of their clothing a try for myself. So let's try some things on. Let's call it market research. I think majority of what I got were pants. I'll give a pant a shot, because, you know, that's where I struggle the most, the waist to hip to ass ratio. Well, this is a matching set, but I think i'mma love this for vacation. Let's do it. Oh, these are kind of cute. Okay, first look happens to not just be pants. It's a matching set. I saw this, and I was like, you know what? This could be great. I'm about to go on vacation, and this is so cute. And wish it doesn't have pockets, but I guess that's what you get with women's clothing. Okay, we started off pretty strong. She's kind of cute. Who? This one has pockets. It kind of looks like scrubs now, but I feel like I could freak this with, like, a tank underneath, open some jewelry. Once I style these up, it'll be different. Okay, we have our first fail. Cargo pants. You know, I thought cargo pants would be cute, but that's a no. Hey, I don't know. The waist is So high on these is giving, like, the recent low of a collection where the, like, they all had on all those, like, super high waist pants. Realistically, for me,. I'll never wear these. So I'm like,. I'm 6 one and I'm a man, so I'm like, even though these are high waisted, these are very long for women. Girl, girl. All of these pants are extremely high waisted. Wow. Another no. I think I've been having more success with the stretch pieces. For me, personally, not terribly mad at these. Yeah. I see myself wearing these to the club. Already tell by the way, this is gonna be questionable. It's looking shaky. Nope. I can't even let y'all see me like this. Maybe. I don't know. They're not, like, an immediate no, because I like the color, but I'm a little concerned about the food. Okay. I don't know. I probably will realistically never wear it. This is very Rihanna coated. Like,. I just need, like, a thigh high boot, a really short short, or some bodysuit situation, and it's the anti World Tour. Mean I won't wear this because it screams, like, plastic and pleather, but okay. It could be a thing for someone else. Actually might have my tailor cut these into shorts for me because the legs are a little wide. Here we got a sweatpants. I don't know, y'all. This kind of shake. This might be my next airport outfit. So soft. Yeah, I like This. Very chic. This is a heap for sure. This must have been an accident. A pogo skirt. Just gonna lay her to the side. Overall, I'll definitely give Pretty Little Thing a try. Like things that have elastic stretch waist on them seem to work. Denim a little too high rise for me lengthwise. Could use a little work in the size and fit department. But overall like cute concepts. Even though I didn't pay for it, fairly priced, so yeah, pretty little thing is a safe option."
1,"Hey guys, it's Indiana Cole, and I'm trying. I'm actually. Hey guys, it's Indiana Cole. Today. I'm gonna be trying something a little bit different. I might make this like a little series. I'm not sure yet. I'm a little nervous. I'm gonna be trying on some clothes from Prettylittlething for my Hawaii trip in June. My brother is clearly psychotic. Anyways, I'm gonna be trying on some pieces for my summer holiday in Hawaii, which is in like a week. Am I prepared for that 15 hour flight? I am not, but I'm excited, so. So. I'm gonna take you with me to try everything on because I'm really nervous. Okay. This is the first one. I think the material is actually very impressive. I wasn't expecting it. Like, it's not cheap at all. And I feel like it kind of sexy when it's kind of form fitting a little bit for it to be mesh. And I also like that it's like right here. It kind of accentuates you a little bit. I'm really impressed, but this is really cute. I give it like a 10 out of 10. I'm gonna go try on the other piece, and let me know which one is your guys favorite. At the end, we're gonna try on this ombre orange cover up. This is so cute. Mind you, I also don't have any shoes on or accessories for all the pieces. Should I do a styling video on how I would Style all of these. It feels really nice on the skin. It's real light. It's kind of the same material as the other one. Honestly, I give this one, like, an 8 out of 10 just because I don't really wear color, so whenever I do, it's, like, so out of my comfort zone. I'm gonna go try on the other piece, and i'mma come back to you guys. I think this might be too small right here. The girls need a little support. I will tailor this so it could be, like, tighter on the waist area. It's so cute, though, don't get me wrong. I feel like I would just have to size up. So cute. Like, the color and the style. I'm so sad. Next. I'm gonna try this on and connect to you guys. This is really cute. This is real see through, though, in the front. I'm gonna need some nipple covers. This is really cute, though. I love the fabric. Like the material. So cute and comfy. It's definitely giving heavy holiday vibes, and I can't wait to see what shoes I pair these with. I give this like a 7 and 12 out of 10, but it's still really cute. Why? I forgot I had this bikini top. I totally forgot to get a pair of bottoms. There's a little under boob happening. I should have sized up, so I definitely could have got an 8 instead of a 6, but it's still Cute"
1,"It's date night, so let's get dressed. For our first piece, we're gonna be putting on this corset. The way that this snatches me up, but y'all gonna have to see it. Can we just admire the way that this is really giving me body? Like, look at my waist. I'm in love with it cause just the way that it's snatching me snatched me to the max. I will keep it real. I low key cannot breathe. But you know what? It's worth it. For our bottoms, we have this puffy skirt, and I'm so excited cause I usually don't wear puffy styles. Let's put it on. Can we just look at how cute this outfit is turning out? Like, this skirt, it's low key giving Swan Lake, but I love it. Reminds me of my ballet. It's so cute. I love how comfy it is. And I love the contrast between, like, the super tight corset and a little puppy skirt. Shoes, we have these super cute gold heels. I love gold. Like, I'm a gold girl all the way. Now that we have the shoes on, it's time for accessories. Look, it's just gonna pull everything together. For my earrings,. I'm gonna be doing these gold earrings. I think they look so cute and they kind of make a statement, which I really like because when we were all black,. I feel like you need something that pops. For a bag,. I have this light old bag, this Is the final fit. I'll be. I'm a dog, but I still want to party like. I'm loving the fit. One more thing we forgot. For perfume, we're gonna be doing LaBelle, which I think is perfect for a date night. It's just so fruity and warm, and I just think it's sexy. Just smells so good. This is our final fit. I feel like a snack. I smell like a snack. I look like a snack. I feel so girly right now, and I love that for me. Let me know what you guys think. How would you guys these pieces? Thank you to Pretty Little Thing for sending me all these pieces, but I gotta go. Thank you guys so much for watching. Bye."
0,"I was so excited for these. As you can see, they don't look exactly like the picture, but honestly, they're not that bad compared to the next pairjust wait. I figured I'd style them pretty basic, match the ties on the top to the ties on the bottom. Overall, 8 out of 10. But thesethese were a personal attack from Molly Mae herself. What are these? I literally ordered the exact same size as the first leggings. I tried to style them, but there was no saving itliterally trash. These I was so excited for. I'm absolutely obsessed; they fit like a glove. I'm in love, but I have no idea how I'm going to hem the bottoms to make them shorter because it's like a pleather material. But still, I love them. This, I fell for the girl's position because what is this? I literally look like Inspector Gadget; it's giving cardboard box. Like when you tie the wrist, it gets cuter, but there's still no shape. Um, maybe if I bent over in the same position that she did, it'd be cute. Um, but no, I was really excited for these pants. I wanted to wear them on vacation, but what is this like? I would have to hem them and get them taken in for them to even remotely look presentable, and they're just such a letdown. And I was so sad because I was so excited for these. Even styling them, they look so bad. This, I really didn't have high expectations, and I'm absolutely blown away. I love this basic brown blazer, and I feel like I can wear it multiple ways. I decided to do something a little bit more risky, or something that I wouldn't wear, and style it this way. But I am so excited to see all the different ways that I can put it in my wardrobe."
1,"Let's do a haul. Everything that's mentioned in this video is from PLT. Like, including the stuff that I'm wearing. Like, it's mentioned from PLT. And I'll include, like, all the names and all that. Good. Like, y'all know, y'all know. I also wanna purpose this by saying this is not, like,. I don't know, everybody's doing, like, big, big holes. I only got, like, basics that I needed at the moment, and whatever shopping I need to do afterwards will be done afterwards. Okay, now let's get into it. Starting off with these 2. This is a top, and it's giving skims. Low key, it's like a cotton blend, so, like, it's not skims, but it's giving skims. Okay. And then I have these sweatpants. Um, they're really cute. I love them. I've been wearing them since I got them. This is like my 3rd day wearing them in a row. Um, if you judge me, you're anti black, so don't even. Don't even let it get there, because I love these shirts so much. Um, I'm CEO of if I like it,. I'm getting another color. So I also got it in. Oh, this is a long sleeve version, but I got it in white, too. This is a white long sleeve, but we'll get to the long sleeves in a minute. I got the white short sleeve, and it looks kind of small, like, when I raise it up, but, like, it's actually. It fits really well. Um,. I got a pink one because I have no pink in my closet. Insane. I have a gray one. It's really cute. I got a stain on it. I had it on the. Earlier, but I got a, like, little oil stain on it, so I kind of have to wait till it goes out, but yeah. And then for long sleeves,. I got the gray long sleeve, and then I got a black one. Actually, take it back when I say that they're skims. Dupes. They're not dupes, but they're really good material. But it's not skims. Like, it's salt, but it's not skims. But they're really good. I. I still feel like you should invest in. I don't know. Then I got these. Beautiful. First of all,. I'm working on, like, my, my tops and my bottoms, like, my basics, building my wardrobe. PLT is perfect. Look at these jeans. Look at these jeans. Like. Like what? You're telling me this isn't cute? It's so cute. Look at the back, like. Haha, I love this so much. But yeah, that's it for the whole. Bye."
1,"It's date night, so let's get dressed. For our main piece, we have this super colorful dress, and I'm so excited to see how this is gonna look like on. Let's go put it on. This is what the dress looks like, and I'm obsessed with it. It's so cute. I feel like it fits really well. It's a little tight around the thighs. I love the colors. And the back is really cute, too, cause it's like a lower back, which I feel like it's very flattering. This dress is amazing. For shoes, we're gonna be putting on these purple shoes, which I think is gonna go really well because there's so many colors in here. Now that it's starting to get warm out,. I wanna start wearing more colors, so starting to get some shoes that are more colorful. Now that we have our shoes on, we're gonna be putting on some accessories. For accessories,. I have this tennis bracelet, and then I have these statement earrings, which I'm really excited about, because I don't have statement earrings like this. I feel like I just got nails again, and I forgot how hard it is to do everything. I don't even know how many times I dropped the backs. These are the earrings, and I think they look really cute. And then I have the bracelet on, and I love it. All you have to do is add a bag, and then we're ready to go. So we Have our bag, and I am loving how everything came out. I love the dress with the shoes and the bag. I feel like the white bag kind of neutralizes the whole look. And I'm really loving everything. This is. This is the final look. What do we think? What do we think? Thank you, pretty little thing, for sending me all these items. I'm in love with them. But now I gotta go, so bye."
1,"obviously, as a plus size model and content creator,. I always get asked where I shop. one of my favorite places is Pretty Little Thing. I have a haul. let's see if anything fits. let's see what works, cause there's some questionable stuff. let's do it already. let's open it up. okay, this first top is super colorful and cute. it has roughly sleeves. I tried this style before and it gave me trouble, so let's see what happens. freaking cute. I love all the colors. I love the ruffally sleeves. so colorful and pretty. the only thing for me is like, this part is always too stretchy. this next top I got about 2 sizes or 3 sizes too big, as you can see, but it was the only size they had, and I was thinking maybe if I really loved it,. I could get it fixed. I think I am. I really, really love the print. the colors are interesting. I love the green. I think it looks really pretty on my skin tone. so I think I'm actually gonna fix this one up, get it taken in so that it fits me properly. I really, really like this. okay, this next piece,. I also got it in a few sizes bigger for my hips because it's no stretch, as you can see, but it still doesn't fit. but it's a really pretty little satin dress. right? the next top is so pretty, but it's too big on me. as you can see, it's falling all the way off and it's supposed to be like here, but it's a really pretty little corset style girly floral top. super, super pretty. just gonna order it in a size down. me. and then this thing is like an oversized, kind of like dad blazer, which I kind of like, but it's definitely more of a fall winter vibe, and it's a little bit heavier than I thought it was gonna be. alright. and then this is a bikini that I actually bought last year. they had it in black. you guys loved it when I posted it on Instagram. so definitely go to my Instagram and like and comment on that. but they came out with it this year in this gorgeous, like, emerald Jade kind of color, and I'm obsessed. I won't show too much because we know how they like to play the big girls, but oh my God. let me know if you want to see more trying hauls."

That this is my life. Really. Like, it's crazy. I wanna thank everyone of you guys and the pretty little thing ever so much enjoyed watching me open this parcel. Let me know what was your favourite thing that was in the box. Thanks much for watching. Bye."
1,"I don't know if it's late to review this stuff, but I'm still gonna review it because we have to support our girl India. So I've got hair, some bits from her collection. How about we try it and style it? Let's go. And so this is the first outfit. What do you guys think? So it is really short. I cannot lie, this skirt is just way out of my comfort zone. But I think together paired up, it looks quite cute. And it just kinda looks like and resembles a mini dress. Paired up with these rose gold heels and also my small little LV bag. So far, this outfit here might be my favourite piece. I'm loving this cream top. Like, who is? Only India? Cause this,. I feel like, is India's signature kind of look, like belts and stuff. And obviously on the first outfit as well, it had a belt, but I love the fact that it's a boob tube top, but it's made in a belt. Like, it's. It's actually stunning. Um. And I love these trousers so much. So comfy, so chilled, but yet it's so stylish. And then I paired it up with a silver bag and some silver heels, just kind of give that matrix fill to the fit. So let me know what you guys think. I think my favourite part of this look is just the trousers as well as the top off. Then I picked nothing, cause my Favourite. Okay, so this is the last look, and you can't tell me it is not giving back D like, honestly. So this is India's dress inside, and then I've wore this jacket, which is also from PLT, but it's not. I don't think it's from her collection. And I've paired up with my Wangs as well as my YSL bag just to give those black and silver detailings in both the bag and the shoe. And then the sunglasses to finish this look. It is giving. Like, honestly,. I feel so cool and so retro in this look. Um, let me know what your favourite was in this collaboration from PLT in India, and I will catch you guys in the comments. Bye."
1,"Hey, guys, unwrap unpackaged, cause this is not a box. My PLT shipment with my kids and paw patrol in the background. Yes! Yeah, I said Paw Patrol. If you guys are watching Paw Patrol first. No, hubby has an event next weekend. Um, he's speaking about our Airbnb business, so he has a nice outfit, and I have to coordinate with him. Duh. I'm pregnant. I am 19 weeks on Monday. So I like pretty little thing. I've ordered some maternity. Maternity things from there before. Um, obviously shoes are not on the tiny thing, and I like their stock, so I'll get to those after. Let's just open up these shoes first. White sock booties. These are real cute. Let's see. I am usually seven and a half. I feel like my feet are wide, though. And then with case,. I feel like it's like, a little bigger. So I got an 8. You guys wear socks? Your sock booties. Bam, Bam. These are knickers. Maternity bump support seamless knickers. I got them in a medium large. They also came in a small medium, and I think they also come in black. But let's try these first. Thought these would be good to support me during my pregnancy, so Super Granny Panties. I have to try those on, see if I like them. And then I got those, like, teardrop earrings. I forgot. Homemade like the original ones, but these are like, I don't even know, 3 or 5. How cute. Okay, let's try them on and see. No, no, no, no. Those are cute. Hi, I'm Samantha. Friends? Yes, we have six Airbnbs. Yes, I'm a stay at home mom. Hey, now I got this. Excuse me. This two piece set. It was separate, but it was like on super sale. I think the skirt was 8 and um, the top was 6. So let's see. I got. It's so cheap. I got two in two different sizes just to see. Cause like you never know with these stores which is gonna fit you better. This is the skirt. The ruthing is where the bump is gonna be. Simple it up here. I think if this is the bigger size, it definitely works. Alright, I guess let's try it out and see part two."
1,"Goodbye. Um, I mean, you stay here. And I would have said to get the parcel if I'm putting lipstick. I don't know what parcel called 5. So let's open it. We also got a lot of money on final Saturday, and this is the outfit, I think, for Friday. I mean, let's try it on. What do you think? Is it too much? I really, really like it. Holy moly. Oh, wow. Okay, let's be honest. You know me. I don't want no one to ask about that. I really, really like it. Like, it's a little bit of, like, skin, like, off the shoulders and white. Yeah. Like, holy moly. And my makeup and everything. Maybe, like, a jacket, but yeah. Oh, my God. This is one pretty little thing. It is in a size 18. You guys ever was like, oh,. I hurt my toe. It is in a size 18.

1,"so basically it's my 5 year anniversary on Saturday, and me and my boyfriend are going out to celebrate on Saturday. but I'm going bowling first and then we're going out to eat. but what do you wear to bowling and going out to eat? cause bowling is so casual, but going out to eat is like proper, like dressy. so I want to order myself some bodysuits that will go with the casualness of bowling but the dressiness of the restaurant. so we're gonna see and hopefully we have some winners in here. so this is the first one I wanna wear. I pray to god this one fits me because this is the one I want to wear, like, because it's stressy enough for like, going out. and I feel like I can dress this down for bowling. but I hope, like if I'm wearing this, people are not thinking, why is she wearing that? but probably no one even cares. but the voice in my head, she's killing me because it's the anxiety and me that's gonna make me think everyone's staring at me when no one's staring at me. do you know what I mean? I actually got some 2 colours. I got this in black and then I got the other one in like a brownie colour. um, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna wear this one like this colour, cause I just feel like, no,. I'm kind of going for a brownie theme. so I'm sorry. try on. but, like,. I do like it. such a good quality, like the thick ribbed material, but, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna wear this one, but this is the other colour, so I'm more likely to wear the first one or this one. um, this is very stretchy, so I feel like this will fit me, but, like, I pray to god that the brown one fits me, because this is, like, my backup. and if the brown one don't fit me,. I'm gonna be devastated, cause I really wanna wear that one, but I'm gonna change and hopefully it goes well. right? I love the top. it's great. it fits in all the right places. I'm happy. but if I drop something on the floor, everyone's gonna get it for a show, and I don't really want that. I might risk it for a biscuit, because I wouldn't wear this top so bad. I literally love it so much, and I'm literally trying to go for this theme, but I'm gonna try the other ones on. yeah. guys, I literally love this body suit, and now I want to wear it because I just feel like it's better. like my Tatas are not gonna fall out, and I'm happy about that. and I just love the color black. it's just so slimming and lovely. so I might wear this one now, because I could dress up with some heels as well and a nice jacket. so this one is not actually out of the game yet. so this is this, like, Nudie colour, and I literally love it so much. it's nice, but I do fall out. I'm sweating towards the black one, but honestly,. I would wear this one as well. so it's between these 2. I'm gonna send back the first one just because, like, my Tatas keep falling out and I just. I don't. I don't want it. but, uh, guys, let me know what you guys think, cause I do value your opinion, but I will catch you in the next one."
1,"I did a bad thing and bought stuff on Pretty Little Thing, and I don't even remember what I bought. I don't think I bought that much stuff, so let's see what I got. Looks like I got two pairs of pants. Pants are always a hit or miss, so we'll see how that goes. And I got two tops and a little purse. Let's try it on. I got really excited when I pulled these out. On camera, they're looking cuter than just in my mirror. Wait a second, okay, these are from the tall section. They're trousers, very tall and long; I'm five eight for reference. I kind of like how they fit; I don't think I should get them changed or altered at all. I mean, part of me likes, you know, a little bit taken in, but it's also kind of cute like baggy. I don't know, help me decide. Let's try on the other ones. Okay, they fit like a dream, but I just don't think I like the fabric. What is this fabric? I need to find a tag. Oh, I'm on the fence, help me decide. Okay, this top is everything; I've been eyeing this top. It was in my little favorites thing on the app forever, and I was like, you know what looks fire on the girl, don't think it's gonna look like that on me, so I didn't buy it for the longest. But this color on brown skin, you can't tell me nothing. I'm already in love with this next top; the freaking color, I did so damn good. But I need to look at the, I gotta button this. But I don't know what this is for. I need to look at the photo because I don't know where these are supposed to go. Okay, looked, and it says you're supposed to tie it just around your neck like this. I guess you could cross it, but I feel like I'll suffocate. I mean, I don't really see the point. I guess you could cut these things off, but I think it's supposed to hold your chi-chis up, like a push-up; it's good. Cute, oh, I forgot that I got this cute purse. This color of blue has just been speaking to me lately. How cute is this? I mean, I don't go anywhere, so I don't know where I'm wearing any of this. But it's in my closet just in case someone invites me somewhere. I probably won't come, but still invite me."
1,"hello, creeds. so I've not done a little haul in a while, so I thought I'd treat you to plc haul. literally had this stuff for way over a month and I just came out of this video, so you can probably see how long ago I've had these out as well, cause this was my outfit. for ABA. abba was the 12th of July. it's now literally like, the 19th of August. but anyways, this is a little place that I wore to abba. I am literally obsessed with it. it was literally the best night of this is another dress that I wore in London. but how stunning. I don't normally wear dresses like this that are literally, like, I wore like a penguin. it's the back. next is this little outfit. not gonna lie. this top is a 6. these are an 8. normally I would get this and an 8 and these in a time, as you can see, they're sticking out a bit. so just suppose, like, this star of the show is these sliders. and I mean, if you hate them, you hate them, but I love them, like, they are pretty sick. you can't lie. these are pretty sick. okay. last but not least is the outfit. I actually wore in York when I went with barney. sorry about this blazer. I'm obsessed with, like, crop laces like this. I just think they're so cute. and obviously these pants. I actually did size up in these. so I got them in a 10 just because I like them to be more low waisted than like high waisted like that. it's just, it's not the look that I want."
1,hi guys so it's been a while since I've done any little outfit videos to be honest. I'm absolutely obsessed with this dress and I have got orange knickers on so but obsessed. I was gonna wear it on holiday but by the time I was coming back it was literally 34 36 degrees and with being knitted I was just dripping in it but because of this like it depends where you going you could wear it on an evening to be honest but yeah I'm absolutely obsessed with it. I'm gonna have to probably book another holiday so I can wear it um but yeah. I love it I'm gonna link them here they've also sent me some khaki cowgirls which obviously different vibe so I'm gonna try them on but yeah I'm obsessed with this dress it's gorgeous these are the cargoes which are they're more like more you can hear they like that kind of shell just a shell like Shelly material but I can't remember what size these are but I absolutely love the fit of them. I'd wear them open like this. I did wear them on holiday with a bikini and more mocha obviously you can zip them up and fasten them but yeah just cute these are really cute little summer vibe pants to wear with sandals on a bikini or trainers whatever. I'm gonna link them both there from Pretty Little Thing
1,"Ah, look what I've got, look what I've got. I'm fucking excited. I'm fucking excited. Cause you remember when I said bad bitch glow up is happening? Yeah, it's fucking happening. It missed like half of the stuff falling out then, so I'm a little bit sad about that. However, yes, yes. That I'm gonna show you now. First is this. I think you could wear this as a top. You? I reckon you could. Me? Uh, but it's actually a skirt. It's a little cute mini skirt. This is stunning. However, uh, my boobs aren't gonna fit that and I'm really sad. So we're gonna have to try that. And I fucking hope that it fits this corset. How sick would that be at like a river festival? Or even just fucking big. Is that sick? This was the most expensive thing. It was 25 quid for a black fucking corset. But I've seen other people wear it and I really like them, so I really hope it's nice. This is another mini skirt, but just in black. Instead I got this Feliz face. I didn't know it was fucking see through. Don't look. See from there. So. Well, well after. Well after. See,. I'm not a fan of one armors. Right, I really are. But we'll see what it looks like and if it looks shocking, then bye. Bye. This were another Leeds first thing, but it's actually really pretty. You could just wear this anywhere. I thought It was a bit more bright. I mean, I'm saying they're all pretty. If they look like shit on, then I'm suing. This is, like, off the shoulder, but that looks big and, like, I'm tiny, so I don't know if it's gonna singe how I wanted it to sing, but we'll see. This. That's stunning. I love that. With a black leather jacket. How sexy is that? Yes. Then this simple black dress. Boom. No, it's not sexy as fuck. Right? I'm excited. I'm excited. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm gonna try them on now."
0,"I have a PLT try on haul. I've already done the whole section, so we're gonna try. make this quick of me trying everything on. okay, this is outfit number one. it's pretty sick, isn't it? look at this. I think I really like this. however, I don't know what I'll do about the underwear situation, because, yeah, I've currently got underwear, but you just gotta hike it up. but then I can't not wear underwear because it's not see through. but, like,. I feel like if I wore no underwear, you'd be able to see. but this is a vibe. and this bag, too. like, she ain't playing, is she? okay, I really like this. okay, this would have been cute, but I feel like. I might rip this if I try and put it over my head. yeah, I just gonna try. skirt is cute, and I've got, like, the perfect colour underwear, but the skirt rides up, so it's a no. okay, this had potential. it really did. um, but what is that like? no, it's just too much. she's doing too much. far too much. but if it was more like this was solid, kind of more like poster girl style, then maybe. but that's a shame. this wasn't the intended fit. this was meant to come with a matching bodysuit, but they haven't sent it, so we've got this bikini top on for now, which. this is team too much. this is too much. but I quite like the leggings, but I can't really tell unless I have the body suit, so I'm gonna have to reorder it and wait and see, to be honest, because I can't tell. okay, the trousers are not fitting on my gym girl cords. I cannot pull them up. they are meant to be low waisted, but, like,. I don't know, maybe I'm not vibing with the pink bikini bottoms. maybe the pink bikini top, but not the bottoms. what do we think with this bag, though? it is kind of like giving, but, yeah, I might try and order a bigger size in the bottoms and figure out the bikini. and finally, is this skirt? the top is from Shein, and I got the skirt to see if it would go together, and actually,. I've outdone myself. it goes pretty well, but I'm feeling like Marge Simpsons, so think it's a no."

I didn't realise it was two different shades of grey as well. Is it? Yeah. Then we have, of course, jeans. Oh, they're quite big. Well, I did get a 12. Don't think they're going to fit me. Oh, I thought pretty little thing. Sizes come up quite small. God damn. Of course this is the Molly Mae one. Hmm. Oh, I think that is the same, but that is. That's an 8 as well. Why would I order two eights? Okay, so turns out it is a different one. No, not for me. This one, it is nice. It just doesn't suit me. No. All the colour, though, and it's just so nice and soft. These are gorgeous. I was really excited about these ones. Like knitted flares. This video really don't do injustice. Got to be tried on. Real high hopes about this one. Look at that colour. That is just stunning. Please don't be too big. Please don't be too big. Sold. Oh, my God, that is stunning. I got to New York in November and this is gonna be the perfect cult. Oops, another coat. So I got this one. I'm kind of hoping I don't like it because I can't keep two coats. Or kinda. Hmm. At least I have never too short coats. On the wall. Why is that only one? Is it not me or does that look really odd? Other than that, I like it. Could you take a minute? But it fastened. Think I'm gonna be keeping the tea. I don't know what I've got. Oh, yes. Oh, they're not what I expected. I thought they're gonna be proper suited pants rather than. Oh, well, we'll try them. Might be nicer on. Oh, for Christ's sake. Why do they order so large? Obviously thinking I'm bigger than what I am. Maybe I should have got 10. I wish I had an ass that big. I really thought pretty little thing is quite small sizes. And lastly, we have these, which are gorgeous, but I think they're gonna be too big. What possessed me to go large? I might be surprised. We'll see. I'll try them on. I just gonna. Because I've got such a tiny little ass."
1,you absolutely did not ask for this haul but I'm gonna do it anyway because I want to show you first up skincare would it be a care haul if I didn't buy skincare took them out of packet to make it a little bit easier two items by Costa X never tried the moisturizer but it was on offer as a two so I thought you know what. I'm gonna give it a go. I've heard great things this snail muking advanced 96 it's like a serum really strange consistency and if you've not tried it before this is kind of what it's like and this is the reason why my skin looks so healthy and hydrated. I couldn't live without it it's a product that I will continue to purchase for the rest of my life. I cannot wait this punch enough if you've not tried it run the only negative thing I've heard about the moisturizer is the packaging that it comes in it comes in a tub as opposed to a pump and the consistency of this is quite strange so people say they do tend to waste a little so just be careful with it but I don't mind the tub. I'm not mad at it because I've got such a good price so I will let you know how I go with that to mention. I will link the skincare products in this video these I bought from Nike online. I got myself some running trainers. I started running a lot more and I've also started doing Crossfit. I would go for Night Pegasus not sure what these are called I'm sorry. I will try and find the brand of them but they were super cheap they were like 65 pound. I think there was 30 off so I thought you know what get those I'm naturally. I chose black. I'm very boring but yeah cute love those this year. I have got a slight obsession with gym stuff. I cannot fit anymore in my um drawers but we'll figure it out um I'm wearing colour outside a brand I undiscovered a few weeks ago through my little boys obsessed. I also did get him two tracksuits but sorry. I didn't have them. I got this little crop top in a size small it was 2999 slightly cheaper than under armour but feels just as good so we'll see naturally it's me we've got to be matching. I got the matching leggings blue and pink again Monterex you're not ready. I've got some colour so I absolutely love this and I did want the matching bra and leggings but I had no size small so I'm gonna wait for those. I just put this away because I'm sure will come back into stock why didn't anyone tell me. PLT on TikTok shop. I'm fuming I do this all the time. I thought I'd ordered the shorts clearly I've missed them and it's also got a little slogan which you know that I'm not in the slogans it says you are exactly where you need to be however it's super tiny you can't really see and this is the vibe I'm going for to travel home from a Beaver so I'm keeping it. I love the fact it's really oversized and it feels really nice. I'm definitely got to order the shorts this tonight because all the ones I have from my boutique. I've already worn and I want something fresh for a Beaver then I got this little matching two piece. I've seen somebody style this shirt on Instagram open with like a little crop top so I think I'm gonna go for the same vibe white chunky trainers of a body bag absolutely love that now you know me. I'm way out of my comfort zone with the color but the fit of the shorts. I am obsessed with so I think I definitely will wear them. I think I'm gonna wear these to travel to London next week obsessed love them

1,"You know what time it is, don't you? It's parcel time. So I've got two parcels from pretty little thing. Now, I know what's inside of these, so we're gonna do a little. Come get ready with me this morning, and I'm gonna open you all. And this is my complete outfit. So first of all, we've got some of the leather look pants, so I'm gonna wear these today. And I thought with my black Chelsea boots and a little top and my coats that I've also got from them, this is my complete outfit for the day. So we're gonna get in these and I'm gonna try them on with you guys. Gonna show you what they look like. Oh, look at these. These are like the leather look. Jean pants. How super cute are these? So they've got, like, no waistband on them, so the waist. The waistband is, like, non existent, if you know what I mean. It's, like, seamless. And then I've got the pretty little thing top, so I thought with a crop top. And then I'm gonna show you the coat, and then I'm gonna show you the full outfit. So let me just get these babies on. I'm gonna tell you what the feel is like and what the sizing is like. So I got them in a UK size 14, so let me get them on. But I've got the pants on. Look at these. So they do up at the Waist. And they're so super stretchy. There's loads and loads a give in the pants and they are so soft. They've got like a rim. A rim, uh, a rib all the way up the pants. But look how nice they make your booty look as well. I'm absolutely loving these pants. They're so super stretchy. And then they've got like a slight wide leg at the bottom. It's not like flare, but they are wide legged. So next we're gonna get the T-shirt on. So this is also from pretty little thing. I don't know whether I might need to change my bra colour, but we'll see. So I got it in like a smaller size just so it's like more of a crop top. How super cute is this little combo together? Absolutely gorgeous. And then I'm gonna wear my Chelsea boots. Let me just get them on. There you go. I've just took it on with my Chelsea boots. Feeling like a badass bitch today. And then last but not least is one of their gorgeous, like, puffer coats. So let me just get in. This is my outfit. I feel like a right biker chick today. I thought this is a cute little outfit. I will try and take the T-shirt if it's still in stock. Wait till you see this. This is absolutely lush. This is a gorgeous. This is one of the bomber jackets. How super cute. Look how nice and thick that is. And then you've got your buttons and you've also. Oh, you got your little tag. And then you've also got your zip as well. Feel like I need to get on a motorbike. My God, that is so freaking thick. This will definitely keep you warm. How cute. I'm absolutely loving this jacket. So this is my outfit for the day, guys. Outfit of the day. And the last thing, the. Honestly, these trousers are the comfiest trousers ever. And they're not really super stick thin either. And they've got a, like I said, a bit of a wide leg with them, so they've got some giving them as well. So I probably cut off size down maybe to a 12, uh, cause these are quite, um, loose on me, but there's loads of giving them. But this jacket just like, it's got two little pockets. Um, you've got your little waistband area, you've. It's like, really, really thick, but it's sort of like the soft material, it's like a soft leather kind of feel. And then you've got your ripped sleeves. How super cute. And then the little T-shirt. But yeah, last but not least, some perfume. Get yourself a little spray before I leave. And away I go. I hope you all have an amazing Tuesday. I will link everything down below for you. Double, double level look today. But super cute. Yeah, absolutely. These are an absolute steal. Honestly, like I said,. I could have probably sized Though. Oh, look at the booty. I'll link it all below in the yellow basket for you to go get yours, guys. Happy Tuesday. Love you all."
1,"This year I really wanna try new styles. So when I saw this photo on a pretty little thing website,. I knew that that is something that I wanted to recreate. So let's do it. I grab the same camo pants. I love a good pair of camo pants. This basic ribbed mock neck tee. This green and leather bomber jacket. This is definitely not my style, but low key I'm obsessed with it. So excited to style it. And then these sunnings, which are definitely not my typical style, but I kind of vibe with them. I like them. Also, this set is from Pretty Little Thing too. They really do have good plus size options. But let's get dressed. They are extremely long on me. I am 5 foot 5. So we are going to change that with a hair tie. No, because why did that work actually so good? I'm definitely gonna be taking some pictures in this outfit for Instagram, so make sure you head over to my Instagram to check them out. I'll give you a little sneak peek at the end. So far, I like. And do some chunky sneakers. I'm already feeling like, so cool in this outfit without the jacket. Okay, what do we think? I slay. The glasses survive. Do I look cool? Cause I feel cool. I do have my hair down, so we should do a slicked back bun with it. This is what the slicked back bun would Look like,. I don't know, kind of slice with it. Is that we giving, like, streetwear, like, cool girl vibes. And I'm for it. I love this outfit. Like I said, head over to my Instagram to see all the pictures I take in this outfit, but I'll give you a little sneak peek. Bye."

1,"Happy Monday! I literally got the cute tops of PLT and it be rude not to check. They are so cute. Like, this has been my most successful PLT haul ever because look at this linen corset. I'm supposed to be going to Ibiza with a brand trip. I can't really see who yet, but I bought this top for Ibiza. Now I like this, but I need size up. I always see tops like this on her CV, but even though the quality is good, they are quite expensive. So when I saw this on PLT,. I was like, oh,. I bought it. Oh, my God, it's literally so stunning. And I also bought it in lilac, so I'll try it on for you. Oh, my gosh. Okay, here is the pink. And the details on this are just insane. It's so cute and it was bit bargain."
0,"Outfit of the day, dress from Purt, bag from Gucci, shoes from Bali, sunglasses from Shein. And this is the outfit of the day."
0,"Oh my God, he was so close. I'm not pregnant,. I've just put weight on. How about we stop this human? Just because the gals put a bit of timber on that. She's up the door. I'm not up the door. I've just put on a few pounds. Let me live. Also means I need you. Call. Let's try them on. Hmm. I love the idea of like a trench. Uh, that was denim. And then when I put it on, I was a bit like, um, so. And this is a size 10. And I also actually bought this in a 12 because I was like,. I don't know what size I am anymore. But there's a room for all of us to get in here. Um, I love the concept, but I think it's gonna be a no. Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Double it. Love entirely. Haha, no, on a real I. I didn't mind the top, but the trousers are giving me the Grinch's feet. Well, the issue of this one is the trousers are far too long. And secondly, you protect us and brothers, they don't fit in this underlying of the cop, so it doesn't make sense. And the other issue is oppose it. But I'll be back. This dress is gorgeous. It fits so well. It's got a nice little slit, which I'll probably actually don't even need to pin it cause it's decent. It's got some rushing going on here. I Can't zip it up because I can't reach, but it fits perfectly and I think it's. And hugging in the right places, it's an absolute. Yes. This, I think maybe the only successful thing. Gorgeous. Gorgeous."
1,so many of y'all liked the first outfit the best and so did I. I don't know what I was thinking so we're gonna wear it today here are the pants they're from Pretty Little thing they are from the tall section but I'm sure they have them in the regular section too and they do also come in black and the bodysuit is from skims this is the fits every body bodysuit and it's probably the best bodysuit. I've ever had in my life. I thought the outfit was a little plain so I added this belt even though there are no belt loops now let's add some jewelry. I love rings. I have 1t of rings also if you're curious about any of my jewelry. I have a full YouTube video with all of my jewelry rings bracelets earrings necklaces everything link in bio watch him subscribe. I'd really appreciate it but anyways back to the jewelry these are the earrings. I chose to wear all I really have are giant silver hoops or little gold hoops and I didn't think either of those really went so I just went with these little studs. I'm mostly ready so then I went downstairs where a little tiger jumped into my lap honestly she's the reason I'm late every day cause she does this and I can't. I can't move. I can't tell her no look at her but we're still on time today it's only 8 07 and I'm basically ready okay shoes. I'm either gonna go with these white sneakers or these little flat sandals. I don't know sneaker sandal sneaker sandal sneaker. I'm a visual gal here are the sneakers what do we think. I kind of love it here are the sandals what do we think kinda hate it if you said the sneakers you were right honestly the outfit altogether. I'm not obsessed but I don't hate it but you know what a bitch was a bitch was on time barely but still on time
1,"I have a huge, pretty little thing, huh? Let's see what these styles look like on a size 14 16. We love a comfy pajamas moment. This is a shorts and shirt set. This is nice and loose, very comfortable. I'm in love. Woo hoo hoo! I was in cozy vibes when I ordered this. This is wonderful. This is the softest, coziest robe I've ever put on my body ever. I'm wearing this for Thanksgiving. These pants are so stretchy, so comfortable. Wide leg at the bottom. Matching little cardigan has bell sleeves. So classy, so comfortable. I look like the cutest little Hershey Kiss. This is a beautiful matching set. Very lightweight and comfy. I love the baggy look. With the right accessories, this is gonna be perfect. Love, love, love, love this black little mock neck as a layering piece for the winter. Jeans are so comfortable. I think they're the right amount of baggy. Does it have a weird smell? Look at this sexy bomber jacket. Kind of a distressed black and brown, which I really dig. Is honestly a vibe. I have plans for this trench coat. This feels like such good quality. I'm so excited about this. We love a cropped, lightweight turtleneck. This is thinner material, so you're not gonna be sweating. You can wear this with a jacket in the winter, and it's gonna feel awesome. And black is just so sleek. I'm such a green girl. This is the perfect little Crop sweatshirt for me. Feels like good quality. I love the distressing on these jeans. I think it's so fun and funky for winter. Even to put, like, some tights on it underneath it if it gets cold. I do think I could have sized down in both of the jeans, so I'm gonna exchange those, but I love the style of these. This is a really sexy winter top. It gives you a little bit of your shoulder, of your little clavicle. It's quarter sleeve, accentuates what we want to accentuate. Very thin and lightweight material, so you can use it as a layering piece as well. And then whenever you get to the restaurant, take off your jacket in. Oh, these are hot. I like these a lot. Last but not least,. I got the cutest little earrings, tiny little gold hoops. I'm gonna have everything linked for you. Let me know if you guys want me to style some of these outfits together, cause I got some ideas, baby."
1,"Hi, guys. I'm back with the pretty little thing haul. Um, first, the skirt. Look how cute it is. Um, it's mesh, is short, um, it's comfortable. I love the pattern. I'm in my rose pattern era, so I'm really into roses right now. Next, I got this jumpsuit. Um,. I guess this is chartreuse, the color. I love how the top, like, snatches my breast like that. And the skirt,. I love that it gives, like, um. I don't know. It gives me old lady, but, like, fashionable old lady. And I like it for some reason, and I really wanted it. Um, but. Yeah. And last but not least, these jeans, which I have been obsessed with for a whole year, and I finally got them in my size, and they were finally in stock, and I'm obsessed with them, and I'm so excited to wear them. And that's it. Bye."
1,"Guys I'm so sorry. I have put the Primark haul into the suitcase but I literally got pyjamas and a few little toiletry bags. It was nothing exciting. And some pound flip flops. But do have a little pretty thing. A little pretty thing. A pretty little thing haul. And I also have the most insane deal from Look Fantastic. I got this full Caudalie gift set for 35 the vinyl Perfect Serum on its own is 50 standalone 50 this is for correcting that Mark so if you're sure the complexion correcting serum you probably heard me rave on about it is stunning it makes your skin just can't explain it then I got the glyconic essence never tried it before heard of the great things about it then I got the moisturizer. I think it's anti aging instantly bright sure so how could honey and I also got. I use this Bondi Sands SPF it's absolutely unbelievable also got 20 off this but it's tinted. I'm not sure what the colours gonna look like on my skin but let me just look at it let me check it too light for me and. I'll give it to my little sister it's not a big deal but yeah it's also if you've never tried Bondi Sands it doesn't leave a white cast it's very glowy silky and smooth and stunning didn't really make much difference to my skin tone but it didn't go ashy so I'm keeping it she Well,. I'm sorry you're not getting it. So. Yeah. Thought it would have been a little bit more tinted, but still a win. SPF 50 Bondi Sands. Again my favourite. This is like a sweet vanilla. Smells stunning. Love it. Super cheap. Gotta protect those lips. Now let's get into Prettylittlething again. I got 25 off. Love it. I love a backing. I got a shirt and matching bikini. Thought that were a free gift. Obviously not. I'll show you this on when I'm on holiday. But this is the bikini top. I always size up and pretty little things. So I got a 10. We don't want any Nicollage, you know what I mean? And I also got a 10 in the knickers. I am a size 8, but I have a big bundle. So yeah, those are the knickers. The colours do not look amazing on camera, but wait till it's on. The mother was blonde though. She looks stunning. Pretty sure is. I'm gonna look stunning too. And I got a shirt. I also got that in the tanks. I like them oversized. They do already come oversized, but they always size up. I've got quite a few of these shirts. I love them. And that's it."
0,"Let's try on clothes from Prettylittlething for my Saint Bart birthday trip. It's giving sick parts. This is a size 4 um, I'm usually a size US 4, so I'm not surprised that it fits me. It does fit long because I mean duh,. I'm like 5ft. This top is a size 4 or the other top I had on was a size 2. Honestly the only difference is this is kind of like falling off my shoulders but you could still see like the pleated by whatever you call this. I tried on a size 2 of the skirt and it fit too tight so like the print was going away which defeated the purpose and like killed the style of it. So I'm gonna stick with the size 4. And then the top. I'm in different. I don't know if I want to go up or go down. Lord guide me through my indecisiveness. I got this 2 piece in 2 different sizes. This top is a UK 10. I probably have it in smaller size but right now the size seems to be working. And then the pants. I think I could have gotten them a bit smaller. Actually no I could not have because then it would be like riding me here. But they're very cute. Of course because I'm sure I probably have to get them cut and then tightened at the ankle because it's supposed to look like this at the ankle and not This. But I was thinking about wearing this with my new Tom Ford heels. Nonetheless. I love the color of this, but the fabric is a little funny for a vacation outfit because it's knit, and usually you wear, like, knit stuff in the winter, but this is not a winter outfit. This is definitely,. I mean, at least for me, a vacation outfit only. Do you like this with my comfort heels? Is it giving bartender? It's giving bartender. So this is the other 2 piece that I got from Prettylittlething. The bottom has absolutely no stretch to it. I'm wearing a size 10, and it's very tight. It's, like, pulling at the hips, and then the top is a little tight up here. The arms fit good. Of course. I feel like it's giving vacation. Bridgerton. I think Bridgerton is the show everybody was watching. It's very cute, but it's also super long. So if you wanted to wear this with sandals, that's probably a dove. You definitely have to wear with heels, and even with heels, again, I'm 5ft, it will still be very long for me. I don't know if I'm gonna wear this. I shop on Shein. Yep. This is the first dress that I ordered. The material is much better in person than it was online. It's super cute. I think I'm going to get it tailored so that the bottom just fits a little more tighter and it just feels more elegant. My Boyfriend said shit about this dress when I ordered it, but I know what I was doing. This is color on me. Wow. Literally take all my money. I actually got this in 2 different colors so I'm about to try on the green one because. I really just couldn't decide which one I wanted. But the pink is pinking. It's giving. I'm tripping. I thought I got the same green, but I actually got it in what looked to be gold, but in person it's definitely yellow. I don't know how to know about the color, but the material and the way it sits is very cute. I don't know why they ate like this. No crumbs. Hey! Nothing about that. Seriously. So I bought this thinking it would be more of a dress. I mean it can be a dress, but you would definitely have to wear spanks under it. Which I can and probably will do. Like spank shorts and obviously pasties. But anyways. I got these 2 cover UPS which I also couldn't decide which one I'm gonna wear on the trip. Um. The blue is giving same farts. The green is just gorgeous. Green just looks really good on my skin, but I can't decide which one I'm gonna go with for this trip. Now for my absolute favorite piece that I ordered from Shein is this one piece bathing suit. Grow the fuck up. Stop mocking me. I am obsessed. It comes with this Little cover up, which is super cute, but it's giving. Also got this little cover up. Um, I don't know if I'm weird. I just thought it was cute. I might not wear it, but I have it just in case. Very cute."
-1,"I got played so badly by Pretty Little Thing. Okay, this is the dress that I ordered. I'm gonna give you a couple seconds to take in the pattern, the colors. What is this? Because I put it on my body and I forgot what I ordered, and I was like,. I don't think I would order this. No, I wouldn't, because it's ugly. Do I look like the model? No, because they're 2 different fucking dresses. County Days"
1,"Have so many packages to open and so little time in the day, so let's get into this and start opening some up. We're gonna start with this package from prettylittlething, because I cannot believe that I'm working with them. And look how cute the little unicorns are. It's adorable. Okay, I'm actually unhealthily obsessed with this shirt. Maybe not with the shorts, but hello. This is literally stunning. Like, the neckline, the cut out, and then you can tie this part up, and then this, like, comes down. Ah,. I don't know. I'm describing it so much. You guys can literally see it. I'm obsessed. This little baby tee is just so cute and soft. I love this one. Now I get why they call it pretty little thing. Look at this little matching set. It's this little skirt and top, and you can probably wear the top as a skirt and the skirt as a top. Someone needs to take me out in this immediately. It's so cute. I love the last thing for this haul is this maxi dress. I am in love with this. The colors are so cute. It's a little velvet, kind of bluey and greeny. The back, like, scoops, and then has these straps here, and it's just. Ugh. It's so flattering. Thank you, pretty little thing. Everyone should go check them out if they haven't already. I'll tag them below. Bye."
1,"I think you know what time it is. this little off the shoulder, puffy sleeve kind of moment. I'm obsessed. like, I'm obsessed with these, like, puffy little sleeves. but how cute is that? this is the set that I'm most looking forward to. this is like these pink cycling shorts. these knitted pink cycling shorts. they're so cute. and it comes with this little top similar to what I'm wearing, actually, which is like a key. I got this one. not gonna lie to you, the quality does not feel great. but can you see it's very like Y2K, very, like 90s. but it is cute, but material is just not doing it for me, you know? I got another 2 piece because these are someone trend. it's this short and shirt kind of trend. it's like, really floaty. and then here is the shirt that goes with it. I'm thinking of maybe tucking one side in, or maybe just, like, doing it all up, all tucked into the shorts. maybe. I don't know. another color that's similar to the last one I just showed you, but it's in this royal blue. like, what? look how cute this is. and then again, it's the shirt, but the sleeves are like, really belly. I don't even know if I can show you. this is the shirt. and then the sleeves are like this. not really too sure. we'll see what it looks like on. I think a lot of you are gonna like this. I got this, like, really long midi skirt. look how cute the color is. and, like, all the patterns. and then it comes with this, like, top thing, and it goes round. it's like. it's all strings of that, so I can't really show you, but, yeah, that's it."
1,"Let's do a pretty little thing haul. First up is this cute little crop top. Y'all know I'm a fan of the graphic crop top, so I had to pick up another one. I love the way this one is cropped. It is a little bit tight, so definitely size up one. Also got these super cute white sunglasses. I've been waiting to get some white sunglasses for a minute. I had to go and pick up this super cute mini beach bag. It kind of reminds me of the Jack Moose. I don't know how to say the word. I'm not a luxury girl, but it reminds me of that bag, and I just feel like this would be super cute for, like, a beach dinner. Do you see this color combo? When I saw this shirt,. I just knew I needed it immediately to go with these pants, and I'm so glad I did it because this is perfect for, like, a dinner. And then they got this cute little slit on the side. Don't play with it. Like, Do I even need to say anything? Y'all see the expression on my face? I know it's still summertime, but when I saw this shirt,. I knew it would be perfect for the fall. And they have so many different colors. I was like, yeah, go ahead and put it in the cart. I cut it again with my miniskirt Era. I really wanted a pinstripe miniskirt. And Pretty Little Thing came through. I got this one in a size 4, and it fits me perfectly. This one's a little bit different from my style that y'all are used to, but I have an internship this month, so I need more corporate girl clothes, and I feel like this is perfect. It's a little maxi skirt. Bye."
1,"So I've got a pretty little thing. So. So basically, the other day, um,. I mean, Charlie's had a discount cost. That was like my excuse to buy stuff. And pretty little thing. So I've got whole. She got this the other day, but like, I haven't opened it because I don't wanna like, ruin showing the lovely unicorn packaging, you know? So now we're gonna open. I'm literally so excited. So like, all of the things that I've got were like tops, cause I was thinking cargoes, and this is what I think about. Yeah. I'm so excited for all the things. I got 4 tops. So let's go with this 11. I was loving this, like, kind of. I don't know what you call it. I love this kind of print, though. Look how lovely. This is gonna go nice with my like, um, beige cargoes,. I think all black cargoes. Look how cute. I literally love the style. Obsessed. And I actually got another one like that as well, which I think is like a longer top. Not like longer, but I think just like a boob tube thing at the top. Anyways. Okay. Oh, wow. Okay. How do I work this? Oh, my god. It's see through. Oh my god. That was not why I. Oh my god. No. When I saw the model put it on, it didn't look like. Looks. It's like see through. It doesn't look like it on camera, though. I have To put, like, a top underneath. This is so cute. I love this style. No, but honestly, that print is so nice. This. I'm actually obsessed with this top. There was, like, they didn't have a size small, so I just thought, you know what? I'm just gonna get m. And I think it would look nice, because it'll be, like, a bit more, like, baggy on the arm. That's cute. As I've been really, like, an oversized t shirts recently,. I got 2 t shirts, I think. I'm not sure how much they were with discount, but I think they're originally 12 which really isn't that bad but first of all oh my god I love this so it's like an. RT one I got this in the size medium as well so I wanted it like extra like big look how with cargoes as I say obsessed no but this top is so nice. I wanted to get one from Zara but I found one pretty little thing and then other top I got was another oversized one and it has like car has car on it I think get out the bag you know rip the bag oh in New York City oh my God I love this so like warm as well like cotton obsessed let's bring this with me on holiday these t shirts actually love so yeah that's my pretty little thing so I'm actually obsessed with everything I got. I mean I can't lie To you, this thing. I'm slightly unsure what I meant to do with this because it's, like, see through. But we'll. We'll work with it. But, yeah, that's my whole. I'm actually so happy with the t shirts. Like, obsessed. Oh, my God, I'm so happy."
1,"And I'm so excited because it's all pink. Oh my God, this is so cute. I'll be honest, the pants are a little long, but like the top is perfect. She's giving... I somehow got her on without getting my makeup on, so that's a slay. There's nothing a little hem can't fix. This fit is low key giving like reverse Fine Line Harry Styles as well, and I'm not mad about that either. Next up are these pink shorts, which I love. I love the fit of them. They have comfy pockets like their linen material, but get this, there's a matching top. We have a cute little throw-over button-up. Like how cute would this be like at the beach? Like imagine this with some sunnies and a little like Margarita in her hand. I also got this cute little shoulder bag, and she's a little bit like more hot pink, so she's not a perfect match, but I feel like I could get away with it. Like the girlies are in their pink era these days. So anyway, y'all, that's everything I got. Have a great day, bye."
1,"Let's do a fall pretty little thing haul, starting out with this gorgeous knit matching set. I'm actually obsessed. I picked up both the skirt and the top in a size extra small. I literally think this might be my favorite little fall matching set because I don't have a skirt long sleeve matching set. Like, what have I been doing? The color of this is insane. I love sage green. Y'all will not see too much green in my closet, but sage green I can get down with. The pants are literally, like, perfectly fitted around my waist, so I love that I picked up the pants in a US2, and then the top is also in the US, too. This set is super versatile, and the vibe can easily change to whatever you want it to be. Last but not least is this super cute charcoal gray maxi skirt. And I've been looking for a skirt that I can wear with my dad sneakers. Okay. I feel like this is the perfect balance. Like, this is a good skirt if you wanna do a streetwear look. You can just make this, like, so fall because it's a long skirt, so it's gonna keep you warm. They have a real pockets in the back. What girl don't wanna start with some khakis? I wish it was a little bit tighter. I got a size US2, which is my normal size, so I probably could have gone with the US0. But let me know if y'all think it looks too big. All the links are in my bio under my LTK. Bye."
1,so I am going to Turkey in 2 and 12 weeks now for my 21st birthday and pretty little thing it kindly sent me some like outfits that I wanna wear but I want you to help me pick which one I should wear on my 21st because they're all like a solid 10 and I'm not sure which one takes it like that other level but yeah please will actually help me if anyone sees this so this is the first one second nice khaki colour it is supposed to be a bikini cover but because it's so thick. I feel like you can actually wear this as an outfit and the arms are like this this is the back which I think look it's not see through at all so I do feel like I could wear this one and I love the fact that it's cocky because it's like my favourite colour green and yeah I just think this one's like a solid it's a solid 10 this is like this is number one to the small one so this is what it looks like from like a different angle because I think it looks better from this angle so this is the second one which I do actually really really like and it does make me look like I've got like a little curve and this is the back but this one does go all the way down to your feet which I think is really cute in like some sandals yeah I like this one. I think this one's really nice with a little bit of tape so these look a little bit more like that plus I'm in like dark like no bright underwear and you can't really see it through this which is like a solid this is. I thought this is be in the first one this is number 2 so this is it from this angle and you can kinda see how long it actually is okay so I think we have a winner it's got a slit down the side which I think is really nice but it does go all the way to the floor which I think is really really nice with the matching top. I feel like this is a win it's really hard to show this one on camera because it's so long but in real life this one has like stole the show like definitely stole the show like I love it like this is probably gonna be my birthday outfit but yeah anyway this is number 3 so will you still help me pick in case like the majority of the vote is a different one but I really like this one
-1,I've got two dresses to try on from Pretty Little Thing one of them. I think is gonna be my birthday dress but in the day and you have wanted to relax so I wanted to get it but yeah let me show you. I'm gonna try on this one. I think I wanna be my birthday dress it's nothing fancy because we literally just having like a little fun lunch in my garden and I thought this would be just adorable. I don't know I think it. I had to get size 12 but why on earth does that look so short but so wide oh stop here I don't have another option but yeah do you not think that looks a bit wide but then it also looks a bit short is a size 12 because I didn't do a size 8 or a 10 so I got 12 but don't know I love the pattern on that though but I will try them all at the end to show you oh my God I really hope that fits and I also got this brown dress this isn't for my BDO but I just thought it looked cute it's like that and it's got a little split down the side should we just try them on and I'll show you what they look like okay this is a dress and honestly. I don't love it. I had like high hopes for this but I don't know it just doesn't I want it to be like that like tighter but then look how short that is you can honestly almost see my bum but yeah unfortunately. I think I might take this back do I love it do I hate it. I think I don't like it. I really wanted to like this but I just don't like it you'll have to find another B day outfit because it's it's it's making me look like I've got. I don't know because it's like bit baggy so it's making me look like I don't have a little thing. I don't know. I don't know please help me decide if you don't like it please just tell me because I don't think I do this is the next dress not for my birthday like this is so overdressed that I wanted to be on my birthday but it's cute but I feel like it's just. I don't really like this either oh. I don't know if I'm gonna post this video because I just look really gross but no no I even bother buying anything of pretty little thing it's always shite
1,"Let's try my new pretty little thing. Gym sets together. So I'll probably wear this more. So, Aaron, not necessarily to the gym because I'm a sweater. Super. How is it? You need to cover up your punch. You can. She's the moment. Don't know what workout I'm doing this, but something's going to get done. Yeah. I absolutely love monochromatic looks. Simple, cute, but effective."
0,it does blow my brains when I receive a parcel from none other than pretty little thing this is actually left in my bin outside and it was dripping soaking Mike said. I hope they bath us yeah funny somewhere actually take it back oh my God the ultimate tampon kit find the perfect tampon for you there's loads of different sizes in there how crazy is that I really wasn't expecting that. I don't even wanna show you yet cause I'm gonna show you when it's on but this is the most stunning two piece. I don't even think you ready. I'm gonna put it on before I put the dress on likes more interested in the different size um put it in here so let's. I really do think it's amazing gesture oh my God I like the packaging and I don't usually tampons I don't like. I like pads each of their own and all that. Michael shut your fucking mouth so the different is different flows according to this sculpture light medium flow a medium heavy flow and then a heavy flow good to know right so I tempted to try on this stunning two piece. I have them both in a 12 and the skirt fits me lovely. I still got room like it really is stunning but when I had Mike to do up the zip it literally just when I got in the mic it did indeed that's all I can describe fizzled apart by message pretty little thing and they said to send it back and they'll send out another one but I'm not gonna lie. I don't know how to send it back but what are the color could it be with the skirt see that would look gorgeous. I just don't understand why it didn't fit me really confused because like a 14 is a little bit big but then the 12 was no go no go that popped on the just a white vest of my brain looks old than the color is just not it's not it's not a vibe
0,it has a gap see wobble wobble you know if you're gonna wear a full one piece it's got a but my boobs look fantastic it doesn't fit how I would want it to fit so where the fuck am I going in this suckle blue why did I even add this in here. I'm kind of digging it but I would wear it nowhere. I don't go anywhere but fucking target and to get bubble tea what compelled me to add this to my cart this is cute right because what the fuck even wear this to but where would I wear it oh my god to know how to get this done on the first try. I'm trying to figure out how to tie this thing this is cute it's like did I get invited to Coachella and I don't was I drunk and it's too big or did I convince myself I was invited because. I mean the boobs the titties are tittying okay wow wow we wow average wobble um. I didn't know where would I wear this to oh my god I look like a freak out even with these jeans maybe not these are mom jeans but still not like mom jeans it's just this bodysuit but it's. I don't know about this one cause where would I wear it what are you doing it doesn't fit and it's not ignore my clothes. I don't have a bra on because I can't figure out which bra um more my style. I feel like you gotta be into some freaky shit what are you it's not from Pretty Little Things but let's do it why do that this is not my style. I don't know like I'm a mom wearing jeans like they're literally mom G sleeve are you gonna pick up your son from aftercare in this how early is too early to be going through midlife crisis because ma'am where are you going again think I'm wearing it right let's do a Pretty Little Thing haul so in this haul I didn't really get any pants but I got a bunch of tops so I'm going to try them on with a pair of pants
1,"I have a giant, pretty little thing also. Let's get into it. As always, discount code will be here, and I will put links to everything and everything I bought, like, subtitles. Yeah. Okay. So first cutie little set is this little, like, corset top, and it was so unique. Like, it looks like it's from revolve. And the parachute pants are just, like, such a side, because I'm over, like, the leather pants. Look, you see me at 1bar? Post it up. Like, what are you doing? The best part about this is serious. I could, like, be throwing it back for a real one, and this would not go anywhere. Yeah, I need boob tape that. Because, like, imagine this is the matching top to the pants. You can make these also, like, low rise, so show off the back moment. But I love this, and it's really comfortable, too. And, like, if you're also, like, bigger chested, it's gonna work. My friend tried on to see if she would like it, and it still, like, worked for her, and it looked a lot better on her because she's got, you know. But I still love this. Like, good streetwear. Put some Jordans with it. Super cute. This one is really out of my comfort zone, but I'm really excited to wear her going out. I just think it's so. It's so different, and it's so cute. I'm looking, like, really hyper today, so, like, sorry, best friend. Jessica. Tripod literally just broke. But this one, I need to, like, zip it up or fashion tape it, but it's, like, a skirt and a little matching top, but, yeah, pretty little thing. Slade. Word."
1,"Pick up some bits from pretty little thing. So let's see what I've got. I can't actually remember what I picked up, but I'm really excited. First thing I picked up. Oh, my god. That is unreal. The Wash Car. Keyboard detail crop denim jacket in a size eight. How unreal is this? I'm literally obsessed. Stop it. And to go with the jacket, got these. I think these are jeans. So these are the petite wash green roost straight leg denim jeans in a size 8, huh? Oh, my God. They're like roost down the side. Got that. They look like that. I think the greens go together. Jeans are a little bit darker than the jacket, but. I feel like that would still go really nicely together. Imagine wearing this with, like, a little white crop top underneath. Picked up this navy contour sculpt, contrast binding. What's this jumpsuit? That is so nice. I got this in a size 8 2, so I'm hoping it fits me. It's got, like, the zip down the back to get it on and off, then it just has the white lining down the middle. I really like navy at the moment, so this looks so cute with, like, a navy cap. Talking about navy caps. I got one. Completely forgot I picked up this cap. This is the Navy Miami basic cap. How sick is that? And I got these mid blue wash waistband detail hemstray jeans. I got these in A size 8 as well. Can you forget what you ordered? And then when it comes, it's like really exciting. They're so nice. I love them. I think I got this top to go with the jeans, but not sure if they're the same colour. It's quite big. That looks huge. This is size 8. Are the tops a little bit more blue? But I feel like that would be alright, you know,. I don't know,. I have to try it on. So I got a white structured contour, ribbed round neck, long sleeve crop. Um, this is obviously to go with the green jeans and the green jacket. So I've got a top as well that is such good quality. It's really thick and it doesn't look see through, which is so good because I hate when I get a white long sleeve top and it's really see through. So nice. Final thing I got was this coat. Oh! Oh my God. Massive. This is the grey belted fur maxi coat and I got it in a size 6. It's like half light grey and then a dark grey at the bottom. If you wanna try and hold with all of these pieces, then let me know."

1,"If you like me and could not say no to plts 5 off on Black Friday, then you know what it is. I actually had to go on and spend money. I was like, 40 off. I thought I'd unbox it with you all and just try it all on in one video. Um, so, yeah, I kind of didn't need anything. The offer just enticed me, and then it went on the website and of course, found things that I wanted. As you can tell,. I'm really into my jogger. These pills? Yeah, actually,. I'm really into my joggers this year. I've been wearing jogger sets in town, just throughout the day, in the house, even, like, out and about to do things with people. I just love wearing joggers this time of year. So I wanted to have, like, a matching set. I do have some matching sets, but I just warm. If I'm wearing joggers,. I want it to be matching. So 40 off. This was actually dirt cheap. And I don't have really, like, a colourful one. I have, like, lots of neutrals,. Browns, greys, whites, blacks. But I thought this just look really vibey with, like, an oversized puffer black jacket or something. Okay. I'm lowkey obsessed with this. I kind of love popper red. The only thing is they need. They are like, long but normal P L T. I put them on and I like trailing on the floor and I'm like, yes, but I don't know about the lengthwise. I'm gonna try them on trainers, but I love that. I probably will keep this next. This is something I've eyed up on the pretty little thing website for,. I'd literally say like three months, but they're like over 50 quid. And I was just like, no,. I'm not spending nearly 60 quid on them. Like Zara one. Sixty quid. I want a PLC to be a bit cheaper, obviously 40 off. Managed to get my hands on these cargoes. I just pray that they look amazing. Got them in a size 10, so I want them to be a bit oversized and I'm thinking, should I even got the 12 cause they look small, but I don't know,. I'm just hoping the length is perfect. I'm scared for the length, but I just absolutely love these cargoes. I think they're really, really cool. I got this bodysuit basically on Black Friday. I was gonna get skins for Christmas and I didn't actually rate the skims sale. Like all the actual really good stuff was in the sale. So I was just obviously shopping on PLT and I saw this coloured like, bodysuit and it was similar to a skims one I was gonna get. So I just thought,. I'm just gonna get PLT. But it's really nice. It's like this gorgeous, like ripped. It's quite thick as well. Absolutely obsessed with this bodysuit. I feel like this bodysuit with like blue jeans. I feel Like he's giving like in my Molly Mae era. Imagine having like mini uggs on it with blue jeans. So cute. I'm low key so gutted about cargos. I wish I got a 12. They just fit in a bit too tight. I really like how much am I putting on? Well, I don't know, but they're just too short as well. Like look, if I wore like,. I don't know, like I. I like trousers to literally be to the floor and then like to my heel. I don't know,. I might have to try them on with a few things but my instant reaction is they're just too short. I might just have to bite the bullet and get like the 60 pound Fashion Nova ones. This one if you thinking girl maths was kind of free cause I got 40 off it and basically. I had this jacket and then a few months ago lost it. I was out in Manchester and put it down and forgot it when I was leaving a bar and I was gutted because I wore it all the time. It's like my perfect jacket for like when you've got like cargos and a nice top, jeans and a nice top, like a nice fitting dress. This is like my going out jacket, but it's just like the perfect cropped jacket so like have your arms covered on a night out, but then it's not like taking away from your outfit. This Is the jacket I'm wearing in a size small? I just love how cropped is. Yeah, it's so cute. You can zip up as well if you want it, too. And then obviously it's got this kind of, like, motocross like vibe to it, and it's got all this, like, detail on the sleeves, but. Yeah,. I just really like this jacket. I can't wait to just wear it out and not lose it. Okay, next. I just. This was the first thing I put in my basket, actually. I just think I clicked on, like, the 40 off sign and, you know, they just thought I would give you a random selection. This was near the top,. I think it's fairly new, and it was from the shapewear. How gorgeous is this? Like, mesh? It's all mesh. Just like, um, maxi dress. Um, and I got 6 cause it was from the shapewear. Um, so I cannot wait to get this on. I just feel like that would be really cute for, like, a little date night or dinner with the girls. I'm actually off for a really nice dinner with the girls in a couple of weeks, so I thought this could be cute. Love this. Glad I went with the 6. I always feel like when you go in shapewear in dresses, 6 is always fit me better, but then the size 10 cargoes and just didn't fit. I don't. I don't get the sizing. But anyway, Um, love it. Love the pattern. I just put a grey bodysuit underneath it for now, but you could, like, put so many different things. Obviously, it's a little bit cheeky in the back, but it's so cute. Can't wait to wear this one out. I love a little maxi moment."
1,"Pretty little thing. Sent me a bunch of stuff, so let's try it on. Our first piece I'm super excited about. I always wanted a jacket like this. I'm so excited. I think. Doesn't smell. I thought I smelled something fishy. It doesn't smell fishy. Oh, this is cute. I probably should have sized up in this. It's just a little tight upper arm area. Otherwise, it feels pretty good. It looks pretty cute. I think this is gonna look better with pants. So you know what? Let me actually put on some pants, and then you can see the vision. But I put some pants on. Actually pretty warm because of how fuzzy is on the inside. This is what it looks like from the back. I just think these are not the pants for this, but I think with the right outfit, the jacket would be popping. Our next piece is just this basic top. If y'all need a basic black long sleeve, y'all need to get this one. It is so soft, so stretchy, so comfortable. I feel like it looks really good for some reason. For something so basic, it's given a lot. For our next piece, we have this trench coat, and this is one of those items that I wish. I would have gotten years ago. I love it. I was a little worried there because, like, it's been a little tight. When I put that first leave on,. I probably wouldn't ever really Wear clothes. But if I did kind of eat it. Love the color. It's called gray, but I feel like it's giving more beige. This is the coat from the back. Oh, I'm loving this. Our next piece is this basic tank. This is nice and thick. It feels so stretchy. It's soft, it's not squeezing anything. This is what it looks like from the back. Y'all need to hit a pretty little thing for your basics, cause they're eating this. Next piece I have is a slouchy cardigan. Not more knitted pieces. I was looking for something knitted. Even a little off the shoulder moment. Oh, this is so cute. If I could get, like, some really nice knitted pants, that would be the ultimate cozy girl outfit. Feels really nice and warm. This is what it looks like on. Completely. For first pair of shoes, we have these boots. I feel like they're gonna go really well with this cozy vibe. So this is what the boots look like on. The shoes are actually pretty warm, and I like that they have a little bit of a platform, cause I'm sure. You know what? I'm gonna take all the help I can get. For our next shoes, we have these boots. I've wanted boots like this for such a long time,. I just never came around to getting them. This is what they look like on. These are also really cute with a skirt or more grungy outfit. These would look really nice. I really like all the pieces I got. If I had to choose a favorite, probably the first jacket. Although I really like that black long sleeve. I just have so many black ones. That one is probably my best one at this point. Let me know what your favorite piece was. Thank you guys so much for watching."
1,"The Beyonce boots have arrived. Oh, my God. Right? I'm off to Beyonce on Monday. I'm so excited. And I saw these boots on prettylittlething, and I was like, these boots scream Beyonce Renaissance World Tour. And I had to get my hands on them. I'm gonna do, like, out, like, a whole, like, what I'm gonna wear to Beyonce. But these boots deserve their own video. Damn, I'm so excited. And this is just one of them. Tell me that doesn't scream Beyonce. Right, so I've got the. I've got the tassels. The tassels are in. Right? I've got this silver design, and I lie down a bit so you have the see the reflection as much. Look, the detail. And then the best thing about them, in my opinion, they have, like, so they gonna carry on going up my leg, and they have a belt that attaches that I'm gonna, like, attach around some shorts. Should I just get them on Alien Superstar? I'm obsessed. Obviously, I'm gonna have my full outfit with them. I just want to show you. I feel like he has, like, made my renaissance dreams come true with these boots. I mean, I knew I was gonna go extra, but this is, like,. Yee haw, baby. Obviously, I'm gonna have the cowboy hat. I'm gonna do a big outfit reel on Monday, but I just needed to give these. Oh,. I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed. I'm gonna do a quick little video as Well, as just like, other kind of, like, outfit options. But I'll kind of, like, reveal my outfit Monday. But thank you, beauty, for supplying me with these absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous cowboy boots."
0,"So. I'm just drinking milk. It's Friday though. It's Friday, so it's okay. But I don't mean English, not the day. And it was actually all right, but, like, I just couldn't even focus. Like,. I don't know, it's just this random big beating sound constantly. And the nose was constantly sniffling, right? I literally. And we cough was hard. Like, everyone was coughing because everyone had a cold, right? But my cough was the most flammy of everyone. So whenever I tried coughing, I was like. But no, like, sorry. Right. This is about them. But I've got a pretty little thing. Parcel. Because it's my birthday and, like, not this weekend, but next weekend. Oh my God, I'm still gonna be off that. Yeah, that's so funny. But I bought an outfit for my boyfriend and I know what it is. And then probably because I'll just open it for you. Put them up. Right. It was English language, right? And like, she. She could give me an extract and then question on four questions, blah, blah. And then. Yeah, but anyways, it's over with now, so I'm not gonna keep talking about it. Right. Why is this? Hmm. Also, if you're here, um. Some in the background. It's never have ever. But first I got this, like. Oh, that's like. Oh, 1 second. Anyways, I got this, like, white corset top. Cause it's meant to be, like, hot, hopefully. Why won't it open? No. This looks massive. It's a UK for how can it be this big? How's that gonna. Is that gonna fit? I don't know. No, it looks too, like, low. Yeah. No, I'm quite disappointed if it doesn't fit. So I actually really want like a corset top. Right. I'm gonna try it on. Not now, but just wait. I'll probably try on this video if I have enough time anyways. Right. It's like the most thing I've been excited for. I got some black cargos, so I got these cargos for Christmas, but I wanted some black ones. Right. These look after you myself. Like, why is everything look so big? Thing is these are like high waisted, but like, they look really long. I'm afraid that they're gonna be like really baggy. No, like, look like the look. It looks like there's so much that. There's so much of it. Right. The tops, like really big, but you know,. I can sort out like, she's gonna like, like up here, so it's higher up. But I'm not wearing like these. Right. The fit, the absolute massive. I don't know why I haven't. It just changed. I don't know why I forgot to film like the match of these cobbles as well. But I'll see. Um, a full outfit to go for garden party, but like, I'm gonna be sweating in them. I'm gonna try them short as well. I'm done. Bye."

I quite like it okay I also have another top uh I love this it's like the opposite called racer something style neck thing. I really like the style of this but I feel like if I was to wear it.

I just see that my order is apparently divided into 2 packages and the 2nd. Is not yet there. I have me first ordered this overall in 2 sizes. This is the overall. I find the really super cool. But I have recently with pretty little things problem that I the pants are much too long. The pants are too long for me, but the top I find quite short so. The next part is this jean jacket. The has just actually, um, so n bit I took the in larger so that the so n bit oversized is and the has just then ne matching jeans. But that is apparently in the other package.

1,so I did a bit of shopping again and I just picked up the cutest holiday like two piece that I've seen on TikTok it has been out in stock for the longest time but I finally got my hands in it and I have to show you oh yeah I got some baby tape as well because the girl needs it after breastfeeding her daughter you know they droop a bit okay so here's the top and it is absolutely stunning so this was out of stock for literally the longest time obviously it is see through because it is like a beach top so with like the trousers but I think if you just had some covers you could just wear it as an outfit and then obviously we have the trousers so here they are they are a little bit long though. I'm hoping they're not gonna be too long for me cause I'm five foot three. I'm small. I'm shocked okay so I'm hoping it will fit oh I'm gonna have to try this on aren't I
1,"Hello, I got another package, so let's do another unboxing this time with Pretty Little Thing. I never remember what I ordered, but I'm not shocked. It's a lot of color, very typical of me. Okay, so the first thing I ordered is this lace corset top. I mean, it's so beautiful. And I do this all the time; I ordered two on accident, and they're not different sizes. I'm just an idiot. These pants, I mean, I'm so excited. Okay, this order truly gets better and better. These pants... this is whether... this color... I mean, I'm speechless with how good I did this time. Can we just imagine this with the orange pants? I mean, okay, I ordered a lot of glue. Not sure why I'm not mad about it, but um... I don't think these will ever fit me, but I don't know. Maybe when I put them on and tighten them. I'm trying to be positive, but I love the color. And it looks so cute with the blue corset. We'll see. Okay, this is a jumpsuit, and I'm in love with it. But if someone can tell me how I can iron out the wrinkles without ironing it, please help me because I don't know how to do that to any of my other things."
0,"Part 2 of look like him. So I go to the basis tomorrow. Don't look at me. All the video first. It'll be below this one or both, whatever, you know. I mean, this is one of the dresses, but there's also another dress as well. And then there's two dresses in here. So this is for the races. And I. I've got. Mmm. I'm not gonna explain myself again. Just go watch that one. And I feel like this could be the one in here. It really could be. I don't want it to wear yellow forever, the yellow summer vibe. Can't lie. This would be for the beach. Cause it's literally see through. I can't lie. This is not gonna do. It is lovely, do not get me wrong, but it is completely see through. That is meant to be at the side. Then it's meant to be Louis, but I'm not really like Louis Kelly. It is completely see through. Um, yeah, I've got yellow necklace on, to be fair, but so a little slit at the bottom. Let me show you in this thing. Like, it is beautiful. It's definitely a holiday moment. That is not meant to be the side, is it? I swear on the model it was still aside. But honestly, like, I could not be seeing in the races in this. Like, it's gorgeous for a holiday, but fell over not for the races. This dress definitely needs an Iron. But it is one of the most beautiful dresses. I've ever put me body. Like, this is such a holiday moment, but is a racist moment. I'm not sure. Like, I think this is so cute and so sweet, and I think actually really goes with the ginger hair and, like, the little tan lines. I love it. And wait there. So I got this from PLT as well. I just forgot I ordered it until now. That's. That won't go with this,. I don't think, but it definitely will go with that. With the white one I shown you on the other hall. Uh, I don't know. I really don't know. Guys, please. Please help me. It is literally tomorrow. I'm posting this right now. It is tomorrow. Please help me. Um, yeah. Also, let me know if you think I should keep any of them. I'm definitely not keeping up with the yellow one, cause, like, I've not got holiday until September, so. Yeah. Thanks for watching. Bye. Love you. Mwah."

These joggers, which look insane. And guys, white leg joggers are my favorite, but I just feel like I only have black pairs. These are the. So, guys,. I'm obsessed with them. They're so beautiful. And, guys,. I love their thick waistband as well. Like, thick waistband is my favorite. Guys, they look like this, and they're so comfy. Like, so cozy. They are from the petite section, so I got the size up, and I just love them. And guys, you can even kind of have them a bit more high waisted or. I love it when, like, um, joggers are low waisted as well, they look really cool. But yeah, guys, these are the last set that I went for was this beautiful lilac set. It's so stunning. And guys, you've got like, the frayed edges. Well, which is like, lilacy. And. And you have bottoms. They look insane. They're like wide leg bottoms. Cause, guys,.

A pretty little thing. Thank you so much. He got this far as well. Guys,. I'm so sorry it's been a long video, but I'm literally obsessed with everything. But love you guys so much."
1,"I've done some more damage on PLT. I need to stop myself from doing any more online shopping, but I've got some sick pieces, so let's get into it. I didn't pick up much colour, though. Basically, I wanted to make some outfits and this is a cute outfit. Picked up this little crop T-shirt with baby on it in pink and little blue sleeves. And I just picked up these boyfriend jeans to go with. I'm not a major Jean gal, but these look quite nice and I need to start wearing more jeans. This is my type of spring outfit. I'm obsessed. This style of Jean is my kind of style. It's like the perfect straight slash, wide leg. And this little crop T-shirt is so cute. I mean, I own about 100 crop T shirts, but this one is still cute. This next outfit,. I'm hoping it looks as good on as it looked in my head. I picked up these straight leg, like, charcoal trousers. I was going to pair the trousers with this T-shirt and, like, tuck in the T-shirt, and I was hoping it would give, like, a smart cash kind of vibe. Okay, LOL. This does not look as good on as I thought it would. The trousers I love. The quality, feels insane. And I love they've got a little slit. I think with chunky trainers it would look really good. The T-shirt I like, but I'm not sure it goes together. I think like a ash grey or really light grey would look so much nicer. Next I picked up a coward which is gonna be perfect for like the spring summer. It's these like knitted black and white shorts and this racer crop top. I thought this would look sick in the summer. I love this set. This is giving me even like holiday vibes. It's really comfy and soft. The only thing I'm not sure about is how like racer this is, but I still think it's cute. I probably could have size down on the top. This is the last thing I picked up and probably the most me thing from the whole hall. I got myself a short tracksuit. I love this colour as well. It's like not cobalt, but it's not. I don't know how to describe this blue, but I love it. There the shorts and then this is the matching hoodie. I did pick it up in a small as usually I go medium but it's always too big so I actually got a small this time. I'm just never disappointed with a short tracksuit. They just look so good, but they're so easy, they're comfy. This one is so soft inside as well and the quality feels really nice. I am glad that I went for a small as it is still oversized. It's perfect for the spring."
1,i'm going to italy at the end of the month so i've been buying so much clothes let's do this pretty little thing haul i have four bags i'm so excited let's do it cute little razor top is like a furry stretchy material i also got it in white really really cute for layering in the spring and summer and then these little shorts are really cute little sage green color i got them like a size bigger for space but i kind of like the loose fit really cute for summer i picked up these pants which i've been seeing everywhere and they're a really nice material they almost look like a mermaid tail and i got them in a few colors but you can see they're really really big i um you have to size down like three times in these but i don't know should i order them in a smaller size or just no on those got them in green and these really look like the little mermaid tail and i got these in a smaller size um but i don't know i mean maybe for the beach or like a pool party what do you guys think this top is kind of confusing me supposed to be like a cross front but it's just not working and then we have these denim shorts which i think are kind of cute i had to get them again bigger size to fit my hip so i have a lot of space so i don't know if that's even worth having because i would have to get that fixed and then also these are like barely any stretch so it's not like super comfortable when you sit they're like mostly denim but they're really cute for maybe a specific outfit for the summer where i'm gonna be standing more than sitting cause they look really cute standing actually i really like it's this hot pink blazer and it has like a corset style but i think i actually prefer it opened i i don't have any pink blazers and i love the structure of this one i also love the opening here and the lapel of it i think it's just very different it has a little bit of a more designer kind of vibe to it and it's really sleek i really like that next piece is really cute too it's a long blazer but it's like a shorter sleeve i think it also comes with a little i belt or something maybe not i don't know but i really like this one because it's a little bit more airy less material than a regular blazer and i love the color too i also really love this little top super cute this is actually really cute look together super lightweight comfortable love the color i also got this oversized button down don't know if i love it stay tuned for part

1,"Back again with another realistic zara hall. We have very flexible wild pool. Four poses that i would never, ever make in this dress. And then the poor girl is trapped in the dress, trapped inside through the glass she wants to do is get out. It's almost like they're trying to tell us something. As you can see, this is not go down over the breast area and this dress ain't gonna work for me, who has a turtleneck working out. I would not be able to breathe. Also, thank god that my father is not home right now. But like who lets their dirty sneakers, hang out on the wall while you're stretching, like a white, gorgeous wall. That ain't realistic. That's on lima. If you are related to song, do i be punished and you know what? He's probably watching this right now, and i will be punished. Side note, i did get some makeup on the shirt, and i'm sweating under my boobs, so i will be keeping it. You know what? Finding that? I felt that this would look good or fit my body at all. Because i did. I really didn't, but i wanted to give it a shot. I think this top is super cute, super fun. The pants are in excel and absolutely don't even go above my thighs. Which is beyond man beyond. I see what people are going for, but i don't think this about that will ever be right for real. And that's okay. Great dress size x x. L got it from zara fifty. Amazing. And not only is it for events or is it for going out in the town for dinner, actually a special brand that they have meant for washing your cars. Specifically uniform for washing cars. Okay, i'm serious. No, this dress is freaking adorable exactly, but it does not come to love showing all the red parts of it like this is working for me. this is working,"
0,I tried on the viral pants from Zara and you won't believe what happened Well if you haven't heard there are some superviral pants from Zara and I found them at Zara in real plaza Salaverry and I'm usually 38 or 40 in jeans at Zara so I grabbed those two sizes and went to the fitting room I put on my tail and I thought I was going to wait a long time but no that Zara is super modern and has several fitting rooms And well the moment of truth came I tried on size 40 because I always try on the biggest size first and look what happened that button did not go through that hollow eyelet I do not know look it closed me well at the waist. but from there I didn't even want to touch it because it was impossible to pass the buttons Oh well those pants are viral because they reduce your bubbles Hey to take these pants off I suffered a lot I thought I was going to get stuck.
0,hello it's your favourite ZARA leggings girl here something has just been brought to my attention and I think I may have girl bossed a bit too close to the sun. I don't know whether to laugh or cry and also I'm not a size 10. I mean I do take a size 10 in some things but I'm probably had to put it down paper I'm a size 12 but anyway jesus christ. I think this is gonna stretch too far at this point. I literally when did I put that video up less than 48 hours ago
1,"I bought the entire Zara makeup line, so you don't have to. there's a lot of products in this line, and I'm gonna tell you if anything's actually worth getting. you know, it does throw me off a little bit when a clothing brand comes out with makeup. you know, it really makes you wonder, how much effort did they put into this? I always give my opinions on packaging. so for the Zara makeup line, they went with this light gray packaging with a raised, faint, kind of ivory toned Zara logo. every single piece in the line matches that same aesthetic. I think the packaging is just okay. they went for simplicity. I'm not a simple person, so I'm more into the bold and loud stuff. but nonetheless, let's check out the foundation. this is a soft matt foundation. I think the price is a fair. this is 19. here is the packaging of the foundation. I have to say, this is very nice. this is very heavy, and this is some nice glass, just to point it out. it doesn't really matter, but because the bottle is slanted like this, it will lay on your shelf slanted. the shade I am gonna use is C 9 o 6. okay. I'm getting more impressed by the minute. this has a lock pump, which means if you turn it, it'll unlock, and if you turn it back, it locks, which is amazing for travel. okay, let's go in with the foundation,. I did get a shade to match myself. tan. okay, first impression. extremely lightweight, easy blend this, full coverage. okay. the foundation is insanely beautiful. it is a true soft matte, meaning you can still see the radiance in my skin, and it's not overly drying, overly matte, dull. it looks really good. I bought it because it looked incredible on nikki's tutorials, and I have to agree with her. Nikki said the concealer is not good, so I'm really curious cause I am pretty picky about concealer. here's the packaging. when you shade n 9 o 3. nice applicator. not bad. okay, let's blend this out with a sponge and see what we think. blend easily. I see exactly what she's saying. it is a little bit dry, and it's creasin in my lines pretty quickly, so keep that in mind. I also feel like I need to build it. I need a little bit more coverage, but I'm curious if that's gonna make the creasin worse. I feel like it's one of those concealers you need to, like, set it right away. let's do that. I'm gonna go in with a loose setting powder and just place it on top. just pressing that powder right on top of the sponge so the concealer sits really pretty, like, on my chin, on my forehead, and my nose, because they have flat surfaces, but under my eyes, where I have lines, it is just sitting right in them. and actually emphasizing them. so really, keep that in mind. with a concealer, I'd say. I'm not the biggest fan of it. it's smooth, it looks pretty, but the way it's sitting in my lines, that's not gonna work out in the end. all right, go to part 2."
-1,okay I actually think this has got beyond a joke now and I don't know why I keep giving ZARA my money because it's happened again it's happened again these are size 14 a size 14 how in fcks name is this this is actually I can't believe this is happening to me again. I've been personally victimised by ZARA and this is how stupid sizing is with women's clothes this t shirt is a size 8 this jumper is a size 10 but these maybe it was childs aged 14 because there is no argh because they are so nice look Im a little zebra 14. I'm not gonna scream. I'm not gonna scream this time fck you ZARA Ive had enough
0,"in Ginger Nation, we don't do microgens. they're bad for our wallets, they're bad for the environments. no, no, no, no material, girls, but with a contrast and some boundaries. but when the pinks are address went viral, it combined my 2 favorite things in the world. pink and silk mini dresses. so when it finally came back in stock,. I had to get it, and I have to admit, I'm disappointed. I feel like I can make it look good by very much adjusting the chest, but the back was ugly, which I knew the colors beautiful, but the chest top does not work. but as you can tell by my strategically placed hands, if you have a smaller chest, you should. leela, get this dress. it's stunning. and, like, the quality is decent for, like, a zora satin dress. like, what are you expecting? um, but try to believe this is just. it's just not gonna work. but I love it. I'm gonna go find a silk mini dress somewhere else."
1,"guess who did a little bit damage in Zara the other day. I picked up some really cute, like, autumn bits, so let's try it all together. the first blazer of the season. I had to pick this one up from Zara is the blazer. I absolutely love the fit of this and I'm so glad I got it in a medium, because it's like, perfectly oversized. you can never have too many shirts from Zara. this is how it looks. I feel like, this with a leather jacket right there. I'm gonna put it on with black leggings. I feel like this outfit is so nice. got the basic 5 99 white top. I already have one, but it was getting a bit dirty, and I just needed a fresh one. everyone and their mum has this basic, like, top. I just needed a fresh one to wear under shirts like this. and I saw the most stunning corset. my bad. the size medium, like, doesn't fit the top had such big potential. but I just need a bigger size. probably, like, an extra large. I badly wanted a black shirt, and I went everywhere looking for one, and I couldn't find one except from Zara. I absolutely love the sleeves on this. it's very different. it can be smart but casual at the same time."
-1,"this is a quick story about how I bought this Zara dress for a funeral, and then I find this. before I can even try it on my body, there's a hole and what appears to be makeup or blood. Zara. so I'm out of town at this point, and I'm in South Carolina, and there's not a lot of malls. so we have to go to the closest mall. it's not very big, and I know it doesn't have a lot of stores, but when I get there,. I'm like, oh, my God, it's deserted in here. like, what am I supposed to do? I go to the directory, and it says they have all these stores, but they don't. the only store that was open was Rainbow. so I go to Rainbow and Last Ditch Effort, and then my phone died. so this is the dress today is a little rainbow fit for the service. it is a little sweater dress with some rainbow heels, boots. I think the total outfit cost me about 50. so needless to say, rainbow be coming through in the clutch. okay. I paired it with this purse and these glasses. I looked real expensive and exclusive. thank you. Rainbow"
0,"I made 1 video where I style this pair of jeans that I ordered 1 size bigger than my usual size so that it is still big baggi plus you have the kind to tell me that it is 1 little too serious. I should try the smaller size and that's what we'll do. The only thing is that Zara made 1 more mistake in the size they sent me, then instead she sent me uh 27 which is my usual size he sent me 1 26 don't you worry? We try to give you a better idea. I put as ish the mante mesh I had put in my other video. It's as you see, it's not bad Baggy but I keep it as you will join and wear high waist, that makes the butter really shorter. I was discouraged."
-1,"Come with me to have my worst sorry experience ever. I don't even know why I wasted my time coming to the summer sale, but there were some things I didn't get online, so I wanted to see if I could pick them up. And I will jump scare. Like, the place was a mess, y'all. Sorry. Employees were working hard, but y'all were working harder. I stood in the fitting room line for 30 minutes for 3 items to be real disappointed, y'all. Like, real bad. Also, is it just me, or do y'all be feeling like people can see all these dressing rooms? Round of applause for this pink dress. It gave nothing, and these pants did not even come up my legs. Like, what in the world? Needless to say, that was a total and complete fail, and I think I'll stick to doing online shopping for Zara from here on out."
-1,so it really is a large. The text is large. I can't return it So great. This text is medium But if you look closer somebody just tied this on. And now I've waited too long. And now I'm looking. Zara explain yourself. I bought this cardigan a while ago in a size medium and had never worn it
-1,"I got the ugliest thing I could find at Zara and I bought it just to show you. If you guys thought the last thing was ugly, it's not even compared to what I'm about to show you. You've been warned. Okay. What I will take out of this bag. It might shock you. Oh, looks just like plain dress. Maybe I'm being dramatic. Oh, what's that? Caterpillars. You see this? Let's try it on. I don't think you guys are ready to see this. Cause I'm not even ready to see this. So what do we think? Oh my gosh. Goes on. I will say it's extremely see through.

1,"I'm going to see Harry Styles, and naturally,. I bought some silver trousers and I went to Zara because their silver trousers were just the nicest that I found. But they've just turned up and there's two different sizes and. I'm just gonna show you. So I've just bought these from Zara. Right? So to note,. UK 1030. Eight. Right, 36. I'm just gonna prove to you these are exactly the same size. Like, look, where's the difference? Like, where is the actual difference? Like, that is literally the same size, but they're different sizes. Like, one is a 38 and one is a 36, but they are the same size. They also are nowhere near doing up. Like, what"
-1,"We should definitely leave this viral. Zara set to the thick girlies, because if you're not thick, this set is gonna swallow you up and spit you back out. And on top of that, it don't have no pockets. Like what"
-1,"Part 2 why I no longer shop at Zara. These trousers are a size small and they are way too big. This is from the side, you can see there is an enormous amount of space. As with most Zara items, these are made of polyester and viscose, so synthetic fabrics. But you can definitely tell a difference between good quality polyester and bad quality. And this one is bad quality. The fabric gets wrinkled very easily, the lining inside and the way the pockets are sewn just looks awful. If you look closely you can see the stitching is not done very well. This blazer is again made of polyester and synthetic fibers. Just to show you that the majority of Zara's pieces are this quality. I threw this on the couch with a few other items and it gets easily very wrinkled. The lining is also 100 polyester, just to show you. This is the sound that it makes. This dress is aids your dupe and whilst I like the look of it, it literally feels like cardboard on my body. From the side you can tell that the armholes are way too big and it isn't flattering at all."
-1,"It's been well over a year since I last shopped at Zara. I've been working really hard to reduce my fast fashion consumption habits. In fact, I haven't bought much at all in the last year, especially items that are considered fast fashion. When I do decide to purchase something, I try to be really thoughtful about what I'm buying. That being said, I am an imperfect human, and I recently saw this creator wearing a skirt that immediately enamored me. It was so cool and unique, I decided to buy it. To my surprise, the skirt was actually pretty well-made. It's made of 100 cotton, which is something I value when I do shop fast fashion, as I try to stick to natural fibers due to their lower environmental impact. The construction of the skirt impressed me as well; all the seams are clean, and it looks good on. I'll try it on for you, but before that, I discovered a large blood stain on the back. This presents a moral dilemma for me: do I exchange it, knowing it might end up in the trash because of the stain, or do I attempt to remove it myself? I styled it similarly to the original creator, which really spoke to me as I've been collecting vintage soccer jerseys for years. I love the skirt's asymmetrical hemline and the little slit, the cool angled button fly, and the interesting pocket placements. Overall, it's a unique take on the denim maxi skirt. However, the stain is super frustrating, and it's reasons like this that I've cut out most fast fashion from my life. In addition to the shady labor practices and environmental impact, quality control seems non-existent. Now, as the consumer, I'm burdened with deciding what happens to this garment if I exchange it. It may not matter to some, but it does matter to me."
0,"We're going to play this silly, fun game called ""Try On My Online Zara Order with Me"" as a midsize girly. As someone who straddles small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes all at once, according to Zara, this can be a very dangerous game to play, and I might hurt my own feelings. So, stay tuned if you want to see the most realistic Zara haul you've ever seen in your entire life. Okay, we're starting off strong with this pink corset top, which I got in an extra large. I need to start off by saying this is the hardest thing in the world to put on my body, and I'm sweating. It does not fit me well; I mean, it does up, it technically fits me, but one wrong move and my boobies are out. Also, I literally cannot breathe. Like, I can barely put my fingers in there, if you can see that. It's made extremely straight, so this is a hard no. Honestly, I'm just going to keep the top on because it's too hard to take off, so don't mind me. But next, we have these flowy pants in a size extra large. Okay, they go over good, not a good sign. Oh my God, no, alright, these do not give up. I think if I sat down, I would burst right through them, so we're just not going to do any damage to the clothing item and we're going to continue on. I'm actually really sad because these would've been really cute with a little white top for the summer, but no. Okay, next up, we have these satin purple pants, super cute, and the matching purple blazer top thing. My God, this needs to be ironed. Okay, I really like this top, it's a size medium. I think it's really pretty but I'm not kidding, this is as high as the pants go, and I got those in a size large. So we're just going to take those off and pretend that never happened. Do you think I should still keep the top without the pants? I really like it, it's a little bit pajama-E, it definitely needs to be steamed, but I don't know if it's not giving what needs to be given without the pants. Okay, lastly, I got this Jean trench coat in a size medium. I think it fits really well, I do like it. It is summer, so I probably won't be able to wear it for a couple of months, but it was on sale, actually, everything was on sale. So, what do you think, keep or return? I'll probably keep this. I would say that one out of five items is a good day for Zara as a midsize girly."
-1,"Okay, so this is actually my last order before I fully break up with Zara. I had ordered this prior to my used tagless damage shirt arriving yesterday. That really was just. It was it? That's all. All I have left in me. So let's see if this is used. Spoiler alert. I can see a tag. So that's progress. Just got, like, this little denim skirt. I wanna do it with a tucked in, oversized, like, poplin button up. Let's try it on. The way that another human could fit in here with me."
-1,hi this is just a public service announcement for anyone that has ever ordered Zara denim and it fit them first time can you please let me know who you are because it's definitely not Smith thought I'd get some new denim shorts for my hauls these are in the sale and this 12 sold out so I thought oh. I get the 10 made that era because I am definitely a 12 when it comes to denim shorts from Zara no. I would be a size sixteen how is it possible I would be 4 size bigger than I am in Zara denim shorts because not a chance okay yeah made the error of not getting size 12 if these are size 12 they won't fit me. I can't move my bum looks like it's falling off it's not even that big to begin with so that's great

-1,what in the heavens because it's not the first time I've seen people talking about this photograph that's definitely happening. I don't know waiting to be roasted I'm sure the irony maybe for the this cost in the cost of living crisis nobody can afford a heart and can't go these all these poses another poo situation really another keep your head warm maybe is this so that you get um this is very strange she's squatting and it looks a bit like she might need to do a poo maybe we you know like when you squat to do a wee when you just can't hold it in for example if you're on a long run and you need to go behind it but she just looks like that she's she's on an oven she's on a cooker top she's instantly confused by the situation and then just buy all of them and then maybe wear them like that while you're walking around the car boot is she having a baby they just remind me of people who desperately need to go to the toilet that's a little bit what it looks like so now the tellers we need to wear our coats like this and keep our heads warm for the finale what in the actual heaven Zara. I don't get it I don't I don't I don't get it I don't get it is that the situation who knows is she feeling a little sick queasy. I mean is she okay how do these images encourage anybody to buy anything. I'm gonna share some of them with you because I'm like how once I started looking there there was no going back. I was blatantly unawares of how insane Zara's website is don't go to the high street and shopping those shops very often. I don't shop online at those websites very often see because I don't buy that much fast fashion. I have slipped down a rabbit hole
0,Nothing quite like autumn in New York. But it's not only the leaves that change. Something in the air brings out the true colors in everyone.
-1,"I am so annoyed right now because I bought this romper from ZARA, but for the life of me, I cannot button this button. like I'm about to break a nail doing it. but it will not go through all the way. oh, my god, it just went through. wait, it's, like, barely one. I don't know. now I'm wondering if I should have sized down. no, no, I don't want it to be tight. that would be disgusting. I also tucked the collar in because I feel like with my hair down. it just looks a little more casual. also, don't worry. I'm taking this off. I worked out today, so it's still on. I know it looks bad. I look like a spy kid. I know."
-1,I mean honestly where is the quality control here so as you can see this is what it's supposed to look like but it looks like this so first I noticed this little thing and I'm like wait a minute oh and all of a sudden I noticed that it is tied to the side of the bag let's turn her around why are there holes in my bag so I proceed to look where the strap is going okay Zara you guys have really done it this time so I just got this bag so from here it looks like everything's fine where is the quality control in here?
1,"Hi girls yesterday. Finally, after a long time I was able to go to a zara and I fell in love with a lot of things like this suit with a fluid fabric and a divine blue. Look how beautiful and this vest that here looks red, but it was fuchsia,. I thought it was ideal, they wear a lot the outfits, the total look and as you see the prints with bright colors, let's see if you know later which color is the most repeated. Romantic style is also a trend. I thought this crochet dress was super cute, vests are very popular again with quilted embroidery, gingham checks, corsets, romantic style in general, lots of ruffles. a lot of frowning. and a lot of pink in all its versions and this vest that I thought was very nice but it will be very hot. Hello, hello, here I am and here we go to the clothes as more sober and elegant, that super nice transparent blouse, the green raw tones, those are never left to wear, the oranges combined with the green also look quite a lot and look at what pink vichy check pants I thought were nice but too short, this pink skirt very combinable. and here we continue with red and pink tones that is a combination that I love and this little bag that I think is ideal."
0,so. I think with it but they did not despite not still really cool yes over my hips some of with this like the fit through but the same colour fitting.

0,hi TikTok once again dressing room chronicles this color is gorgeous my titties ain't gonna fit in here not at all not at all not at all
0,I've done it again but some of this stuff is for Marnie and some of it is for me for going back to work and that's what we're going to try on today first off I got this oversized blazer going with trousers skirts a night out casual dressed up whatever. I just love the carton colour. I've got a black one and I love it so that's just gonna be a staple then I got the high waisted trousers in oyster not white so like off white and black and I got a medium and a large in both we're gonna try them on and see how we get on cause I'm not really sure whether either of them gonna fit then I also got bodysuit to go with the trousers in large so let me put this on and we'll do a try on can't show you too much but bodysuit is a good fit what I find is cause my boobs are larger sometimes the medium that doesn't cover them where is like obviously my bra is poking out. I will be wearing a different bra with this but all good on that front. I thought let's not go for the medium because I don't want to get depressed straight away these are large and they are fucking tight. I'm gonna need an extra large in these like I've lost 8 pounds in like 5 weeks but they are giving stuffed sausage they are not flattering at all look at that thing is I did their measurements online. I measured my waist and stuff and it says I'd be a medium which is an absolute pile of crap because I don't think I've been a medium in. Zara in my life. I was feeling quite good about losing weight and now I feel like shit. Zara always does this either makes you feel amazing like that black dress that wore on my night out felt so good this is poor this is a large in the other size that is actually terrible I might have to get them in an extra large though just to see or an extra extra large annoying
-1,"and no one's gonna say it, but I will. bitch. why are you guys obsessed with ZARA? like, why? it's like, crowded as fuck. 2nd, it's expensive. it's a special price, but it's like 40 bucks. so I don't get how best to sell. you could really find all of this shit for half of the price on shane. I said what? I said a ZARA is not it."
-1,a fashion crime has been committed against me ha ha guys know I like neutrals. I stick with black and cream and white maybe the occasional blue ha ha so I went out on a limb and I ordered this little number for a party I'm going to and I was so excited I was like. I'm gonna be looking like the cutest little baby angel in the entire world ha ha I can get maybe away with the blazer and like the idea is there but guys wait let me show you something. I've had to put shorts on because oh I dropped something who's wearing this who can wait who's wearing this this is my bum what what is that covering guys ha ha ha we do love the idea of color and we are playing around with color but I will say that Zara this is a little bit of a fail considering that I am 5ft 4 and I do not know a single person whose booty this is covering ha ha did consider maybe keeping the blazer let me try something with it like I mean maybe but I feel like I'm not like dazzled you know what I mean. I think I'd actually preferred if it was long. I don't know what do we think do I keep the blazer I. I don't know but I still love you Zara I will always love you love you guys Mwah

0,"I just wanna hop on this sour trend that's going on at the moment, because this has just happened to me. So I ordered the shorts that are in the photo because I actually have the matching waist coat, which I got in the sales last year, and I was like, oh, my god, it's gonna be such a cute cord. And I actually got them for 1799. They're nine 99 now. But anyway. And they came today, right? And these are the shorts. They're completely different colours. Like, I have the matching waistcoat. That's the waistcoat there. And, like, you can absolutely see the colour difference. Like, that's such a nice pink. And then this. I don't even know what it is. Like, that is such a joke."
0,Currently in ZARA with a very skinny friend of mine and I feel like Im on a spy mission. These clothes they must be made for elves. I truly believe that. Look at this. Thats a size medium. For what? A child! Ive done so many laps around the shop. By the time Im done Im actually going to be skinny enough to wear the clothes
1,"Zara Basics that I would definitely never buy again. Starting with these pants. I simply wouldn't buy this pant again because it's a pant that definitely goes with everything. In other words, it is perfect. Look at the figure on the body. It's too cute, perfect last and it also brings out your buttocks. In other words, it's perfect, it's the ideal pants. Then we move on to this silk shirt that is definitely a problem because I want to wear it with everything. It's too comfortable, fresh, looks super elegant, pretty, goes with whatever you want. It's a problem. The detail with these bodysuits is that you want them in all colors. I mean, they are so comfortable and so beautiful, they look so cute that you really want them in all colors. So imagine and it is so much so that look,. I have it in another color because I love them. I mean, they are definitely a problem. And worst of all,. I don't know if you noticed but I just put together three different outfits with the same pants and they all matched. I would definitely not buy them again."
0,"another day, another shopping adventure. i. you guys, this is super cute. i love the detailing. this is so cute too. alright, so i'm low key annoyed because in both dresses they don't have my size. this is what happens when your fat ass are up. look at this top. it's so cute, but it only goes up to a fucking large. why? like, i fucking can't. okay, zara was a fail. but i did put my order, so i'm gonna do a. so now i'm away to sephora. my basket is full. i can't wait to show you guys what i got when i get home."
0,"guys, I had to show you these trousers and I did a bit of a haul in sale and I wanted some, like, pale pink cargo trousers and these were not what they said on the table. look at this. face it. all the way around like my grandad's fishing trousers. what am I doing with this? bizarre. anybody ordered these and have the same problem, let me know."
-1,"guys, I purchased this choker from Zara for 20 pounds, and I've only used it once. and look at this. this has started to peel off. I mean, seriously, this is not even 2 and it's it's worse than which the things you can find on Aliexpress honestly Zara I need a refund or I need answers"
-1,"Let's get into a hideous Zara return haul. So when I bought these things,. I was in such a good mood. I have great feet, so these look so good on. When I try them on at home, they were too heavy. I was traveling. I was not putting these in my bag. These were actually 2 sizes too small. But for 16, you will buy anything, and they look so great on this dress. Oh, my god. This dress look like I was trying out for Big mama's house. Like,. I thought this was gonna be so cute and chic on. And no, um, the only good thing that I actually did get was not from Zara, but it was from LM, and that's one of my favorite bag brands. And, of course,. I'm keeping"
0,"I like the idea of these boots, but from the side, it's just toes for days. My toe ends right there; that's all extra. I can't; I would trip. Like, very literally."
0,"Hey, girl. Hey. It's your favorite midsize cordita here. And today we are at Zara. Okay, so here's often number one. It's this mesh tube top with these pink trousers that were so stretchy. I was surprised that they were so stretchy, because honestly, shopping at Zara could be a hit or miss, especially if you're a midsize to plus size baddie out there. And here comes the mess. This outfit was giving everything that I needed to give, but the freaking cargo skirt did not close, and it was a size extra large. I had a vision for this outfit with some cream boots for the fall. Like, do you see the vision? I'm gonna order the skirt in a 2 X to see if it fits."
0,"Hello, today I have a tip from zara that you may not have known. If you see a square on the label, it means that the size is as it indicates, if you see a little circle it means that the garment is larger than the size it indicates, and if you see an inverted triangle, it means that the garment is a little tighter than the original size."
0,"I have a question. Who in the hell is designing shirts for Zara? Like, are we putting scrap fabric on shirts? Is half the shirt a cost saving measure? I'd like to know where I'm gonna wear half of these tops. I mean, little in the fact. I can't buy any of them because they won't fit, but explain to me where I'm gonna wear half of these. What is that? It has a tail. This. So many questions. Do we need to send help"
1,"Okay, guys, so this is the first item. It's, like a poofy dress. The bottom. I'm gonna go try it on. I'll be right back. So here's the dress. It's cute. I like it. That's the back of the dress. Don't mind the back of my hair, guys. Do not mind the back of my hair. But the dress is cute. Does it have pockets? It has pockets, yeah. This is cute. So I'm for sure gonna keep this. I just need to get a, like, a bra so can hold me up there, because, you know, your girl is part of the anybody to be committee. But, yeah, this is cute. I like it. I'm gonna go to. I'll show you guys the next item, since right here, it's another dress. So I have this one here. It's, like, sheer at the bottom. Um, based on the picture, this doesn't look like the picture. The picture was getting a lot more than what it looks like in person. But we'll see once we try it on. I'll be back. All right, so this dress is cute. I like it. I like this year here. I like that it's black. You can do this for fall, spring, summer, winter. Um, add color or knots, add accessories, like, make it your own. And I like that it's, like, very light material, and it has the sheer piece here, like, that just adds to it. So I'm for sure keeping this item. As well. Now let's hop on to the next part. So next I have these pants and this bodysuit. I thought this was cute for, like, spring and summer, maybe fall. Just depends on how you feel and how you dress it up,. I guess. But for sure for the spring and the summer. So I'm gonna try this white bodysuit on and these green pants. So I'll be back. All right, so here's this outfit. Not really feeling it. Bodysuit. This is kind of low. And then pants are big. Way too big. And this is extra small. And I got it next long. It says it runs big. Usually I wear small and bottoms, but that's just way too big. Like,. I can't even conceal that. So this is going back in the spot. We're gonna go back. I like the spaghetti strap one better. The bodysuit that they have. So we'll see. I'm gonna try on these. These are, like, Bermuda shorts. Um, and my little sandals. Chunk glass. So is this me? Chunk glass. I'm gonna try these on with this outfit. And, yeah, I'll be back. All right, so here's the next outfit. Have me Chanclas. I think this how you say it in Spanish? Um. Hmm. Questionable. I kind of like the shorts. Kind of don't. And I kind of like the sandals. Kind of dull. Like, this is something I just need to think about. I think it's the top. Yeah. I don't Know, not really feeling this one. I think it's the top that's doing it, but I'm not too sure. So I got this drawstring skirt in this black body suit. I have 3 of these body suits, so the next one is in pink. So I got this in a small. Says it runs big, but it has a drawstring on it. The extra small sold out in my cart, so I was like, let's try the small and see how it works out. Um, so, yeah,. I'll be back to show you guys what this is looking like. Okay, so this one,. I can see why they said size down, and it's not bad in the small, honestly, because of the drawstring, but I cannot draw anymore. I'm gonna see if they have this in my store. But I like how it has pockets. I like how it's, like, kind of cargo style. I don't know. It's just this body suit, bro. This body suit is not it. Anyways,. Gonna try on the next outfit. Um, it's this skirt here. I got it in extra small, so it runs big, so we're gonna see what it's working. All right, so this one,. I mean, the skirt is cute. It just does not fit around my waist the way I want it. Like, it doesn't sit right. Like, I feel like it's supposed to sit like this, and it's just like this, and I'm like, what is this? Oh, I Really wanted this to work. I don't know. Yeah,. I just don't think this will work because it's just. This is bothering me. Only so far, 2 items have worked, and it's been the dresses, and that's it. Disappointing with the sale. Anyways, let's go try on these last 2 things. I know I'm not gonna like the pink bodysuit. This we need shorts under. I didn't realize how. I. I didn't know. Like, I knew, but I didn't know, but I'm. You know, to me. Anyways, let's go try it on. This is the last 2 sets, so I know you guys just saw me turn around because. Anyways, I was trying to do the countdown and whatever. Anyway, so this is the last outfit. I had to put my gym shorts under because this is see through. This is a no. It's not a functional piece. Not all about functional pieces. And this. The color is very pretty, but the neck is just too low for me, and I don't like it being so low. So. Yeah, I'm going to return or exchange these items in store tomorrow depending on what I find. I still have my skirt tomorrow, so I'll try that in the store so that if it doesn't work out,. I can always return it right there since I'm there. What else? Yeah, that's it. So if you guys liked anything, let me know in the comments down below. What was your favorite piece on Me? Um, trying to think. And if you guys have any suggestions for, like, any jar items I can possibly exchange it with, then let me know in the comments down below. Okay, so I will see you guys later. Thanks for watching."

0,"so I bought some jeans while I was at Zara in Spain a couple months ago, and as soon as I wore them, the zipper, like, snapped in half. I've seemed, like, so sad because they're, like, my favorite jeans ever, and the closest Zara to where I live is like 3 hours away. so I try to, like, contact customer support, and their response was, I'm sorry,. I'll have to resolve this in store. like, I don't live by a store, so, like, what am I supposed to do? and I'm trying to figure out to, like, how do I do the sizing? because I got these in Europe, and the sizing runs different from, like, the US site of Zara, then they're, like, international site. and then the response to that was, we apologize for the inconveniences. you will need to return the items in the country from the purchase. my response,. I can't just fly across the world to make a return. we apologize for the inconveniences. since this is according to our store policies, we cannot issue a different resolution. me, like, thinking for a minute,. I can't just fly to Spain to return some jeans. barely."

1,"so then I went into Zara and they got, like all of their sale reduced to, you know, they do, like, the last, last minute offers, and so all their trousers reduced, 1299. and I just could not resist these. so first, these are incredible. so I'm thinking, on holiday, I've got my swimsuit on,. I want some just took over the bottom while I go and buy a cocktail. uh, and it was these elasticated waist, they've got a pocket, but the print, these are amazing. yeah, absolutely love these, so I can't wait to wear them. so then I grabbed these, which were right next to them on the rail. again, 1299, these bright pink suit trousers, and they got a little pocket on the bottom. they're quite long because obviously they're Zara, they don't cater for as little 5ft 2 women, but, yeah, love those. and then when I was in marks and Spencer's, I thought, oh, this would look really good with those trousers. and it is this little orangey red knit. it's like a cotton it with a little round neck. it should have been 25 but with my Sparks. I've got a discount so I managed to get 15 off on it where and then an extra 5 off so it cost me 16 25 but I think that. I need to try it properly but that with those it's gonna look amazing"
1,"Come and have a look at what's new in Zara with me! So starting off I love a white shirt, but I really likes the free detailing on the colour. These tops were giving skims vibe. Such great basics. Love that beige shade. Thought this structured hoodie was gorgeous. Love a good coward set. Thought this knit set was really, really nice. Love that dark grey colour and then I really loved these dresses. They came in black and grey too, thought they'd be perfect for work. How amazing are these jeans? And love these silver heels too. Thought this cold set again was really nice. Perfect for going out. Had this really nice sequin material, gorgeous knit and I'm obsessed with the Sherpa jacket. Love."

0,"This is how we're looking. Hi. We're going to Burnside. While I'm shopping,. I thought I would try this. I have, like, a fear or. I feel so bad if I try something on in a store and I get makeup on it. This veil, so I can try on clothes in the shops and not get makeup everywhere. People, like, boy walking past looking at me like, what the fuck? Let's go. Make up is good. Time to go home is by the jeans. And I have to say, the veil rocks because I didn't get anything on the clothes, which makes me feel so much better. Let's go. Someone just fully stared at me."
-1,"This top from Zara is not a skims dupe, and everyone on this app says that it is. Just because a top is stretchy does not make it a skims dupe. And we have to chill out on the skims comparisons on this app because it's getting out of hand. I have the cotton Jersey, the vintage, the fits, everybody, the soft smoothing collections from skims, and this is giving Shein. I'm sorry. I had to say it because. I'm mad that I wasted my money on this shirt. Bye."
-1,"So I am a huge Zara fan. It is where I find a lot of my more unique or special or more fashion forward pieces. So when I was browsing the website last week. I was really excited to see this vest. It's something I've been looking for. I love how you can unbutton the tap in the bottom button. That is how I recommend wearing a vest. So excited! Ordered it immediately and it arrived today and so disappointed because this is what I got. At first glance we are matching the picture. It looks the same. However, these are fake buttons. They are fixed buttons. There is not a button hole to be found. There is no way to unbutton any of these buttons, let alone the top or the bottom button. I like to unbutton the button so that it drapes over my hips a little bit better, and the top was just a stylish little detail, but nope, that's not happening with these fixed buttons. What the heck Zara? This one sadly has to go back."
0,it's not looking good for me in these boots. I hope I can get it off false alarm I am so confused because the right one. I just pulled this up to get a visual. I'm losing circulation in the left side of my body but knowing these boots were in my Zara order and I just noticed there's like because I have an event next week that I wanted to wear these boots too do we look like I'm like bulging out of these boots kind of obsessed. I'm so annoyed what's in this boot no wings are it's like probably a mouse or something unless my calves are drastically different sizes the right one fits perfect the left one is like cutting off calf circulation sticker Mark on them so it's like super stretchy and comfy let's put my behind you out. I don't know this dress the detail it's that like chenille kind of knit fabric
-1,"right. can we talk about Zara sizing? I just did a huge Zara haul, and, yeah, I don't know what to say about this. these are all the same size. this is an extra small, this is an extra small, and this is an extra small. but look how different they are. they are all different sizes of extra small. like, no wonder we have issues with our body. I mean, how bad is that? honestly? like,. I tried on the beige ones and they just didn't fit right. I was like, okay. like, obviously I'm gonna have to shop somewhere else for other trousers. like, it is what it is. I'm gonna have to get a tailored. but it looks so good on the girl I saw on Instagram. she has the same body type as me, so I was like, what is up with that? like, how come it doesn't look that good on me? then I got charm, the black ones, and they look so good on me. like, phenomenal. snatched waist right by the booty, perfect length. like, look really good. and I was like, wait, did I order a small in the beige ones? and I didn't. they're all extra small, and all of them fit totally different. so what do I do now? like, do I return the other ones? go with the black trousers to Zara and go measure them literally against every beige and off white pants until I find the right extra small that matches the black ones. night"
0,"Back again with another realistic Zara haul. Just kidding. To the girls that can actually pull off leather jackets,. I commend you, because every time I try to wear one,. I look like a biker. Like it with every jacket. It's not to my hair, it's not my headband. I tried this on so many times. I'm sending it back because every time I wear one,. I look like I belong on a motorcycle.

1,"Day two of orientation was really slow and cold, so I ended up going home to change my coat. And then we ended up in Zara. And look at this entrance shop. I am amazed by the color way and how rich it looks. But we was looking around, and I was trying to put fists together, y'all. I had this vision in my head. You see how happy I look? Remember this smile? Because, yeah, when I tried those clothes on, it did not fit the vision in my head. And don't try hate when y'all have a vision in the fit. Don't come out how you expected to come out. Look how boxy this look like. But my skin is given. But, oh,. I love the white shirt, but I wasn't about to buy a white shirt for 20. Even though it fit nice, it just wasn't worth it. Or smart. But we ended up in the kids section, and I would definitely dress my daughter up in those sets. It was so cute. Fun fact, if you've been to the Soho in Zara, you see this section right here, the shoe section. That was my first time there, but I love the layout. Keep in mind, I always go to this Zara. And we had to look at the perfume section. Then I had to check out the self checkout registers. It was cute. And, you know,. Soho is beautiful at night and during the day. Look At the scenery Chef's kiss, we ended off our night in this Asian spot, and I got the lychee, the strawberry and the blueberry. Let me know if you wanna see a reaction video."

Was this in the children's section? Like, honestly, it's. It's. This is a medium look. Look,"
-1,"So listen to this. I bought this dress right here from Zara. As you can see, like, the material is like, um, a faux snakeskin type of material, so I can't really tell if it stretch. It's a polyester, but still can't really tell, right? So I'm ordering offline, so I'm like, well, damn, what size should I get? But they got every size available. So I'm like, well, I don't wanna order it, it's too small. And then I can't get a bigger size, so let me just get two sizes. So just for reference,. I'm like a size 12, um, and it's all right. I'm like a large or extra large, right? Cool. So I say. I'm outsmart this, and i'mma go up. So I get an extra large, and I also get an extra extra large in this dress. I go on vacation, the dress comes while I'm on vacation. So I come home,. I try to dress on. I'm like, yeah, let me start with the extra extra large, cause I know this probably won't be big anyway, and it's just the one, you know, most models are the same. And I'm be like, with extra large, a period, even if I got a little bit of room,. I'm be good. Bitch, that motherfucking extra extra large left in my motherfucking face. I could barely get this dress over my fucking hips. So, um, y'all ladies, you already know the dance we do. Like,. I'm getting The dress on. Finally, I get the dress over my hips. I go to zip that motherfucker. She left my face again. I said, oh, okay, bitch. So now here I am at the mall, about to return both of these damn dresses, because that's 100. And Imma take my ass over to H M, where I know I wear a large, sometimes a medium, and feel like a fucking badass, bitch. Cause they were definitely their number. Or my motherfucking feelings.

-1,"I've just opened a very unsuccessful order from Zara, and it's made me feel a little bit pants, to be honest, because nothing fits and nothing look like it should. I thought I put something on that's gonna cheer me up. The first piece is this cardigan, which, as you can see, it's like a cross between a Jersey and a knit. Teamed it with my jeans and silver ballet pumps. I think the shape of this cardigan is really flattering with the V neck. Not got a top on underneath. Love a bit of batwing. Okay, so it also has a matching skirt. Is to die for for me with the shape of the skirt. I would wear this with boots. Let me get some. These are my trusted hobs boots. I would wear this to the office and out for drinks and dinner as well. But also, I think it would look really nice dressed up. I did some more accessories and jewellery. Maybe a fascinator for a wedding and some nice heels. Let me know what you think."
-1,"All sorts of wrong. I am scared this is not gonna fit me. Far out, guys. This is literally made for a child. Like, no, that's not okay, is it? Like, the top half looks like it's squishing my boobs, it's so short. But. I think this does confirm that I do want a denim dress."
0,"I stopped in, Zara, on my break from work, and what I saw, there were two items in particular that I saw that honestly just baffled me, and I feel like I need to share with the community. It's literally giving. Installing braces at seven and dinner at eight. And you just know if the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter was yossified, he would be rocking this bag.

Also, they just, like, didn't even have my size, so I got a size up. I'm wearing shorts. They thought they were, like, gonna be doing something like these metallic ones that I want from this European brand. I can't see in this light. I don't think it's gonna work. They're like, way too long. Can I make these work? I'm loving this bomber. Can I style these? I'm feeling like it might not be worth it. And then not one, but 2 zebra t shirts. I'm not even gonna try them on. I just gotta go to Zara now, today and return all of this. No, it's not Zara's fault. It's my fault for online shopping at 6 am thinking I could do something with metallic pants, which I can, but I don't think with these."

0,"Please excuse my terrifying look right now, but I was on Zara's website looking at some new stuff and I saw that this dress came with a bag. Because it was like kind of a price, and I was like, a bag that's cute, where's the bag? Well, that's it, that's the bag, that's the bag. What am I supposed to put in that? Literally, that's not even a micro bag. Can we call that a bag, like a purse? That's literally not even a micro bag; that is a necklace. What?"

Tjmaxx is up next. I got these. Nike shorts, athletic. And then this top, which I thought would be cute, like white Jean shorts. The backs pretty cool. It's, like, cut up. Then this, actually from Zara, it's just white tank top. I just went through my closet and throw a ton of basics, so I needed some new ones. Pink tank top with the open back. This tank top is so cute. I love it. With white jeans. Once again, these reddish orange biker shorts, which I would probably roll up at the bottom, but cute bra top however you want to wear it. Like, asymmetrical, cut. And then this black tank top. I'm never gonna fit all this into one video. Cute with cinches on the side. And then these levi's shorts. And then last from TJ Maxx, is this kind of cut out top. Okay, moving out to Arie. I got this set. It's just this blue tank top, and it has matching blue biker shorts. And then I also got these orange, uh, just Running shorts. Okay, moving on to athletic. Um, these super cute. Just black shorts. I needed new pairs of, like, just plain black, cause I'm gonna need a lot of shorts next year. And then I got these. Super comfy. Everybody needs pair of these. They're like double waistband pants. I also totally forgot this one thing from Tjmaxx. It's just like the shiny bikini, and it has matching bottoms, and it's sparkly. Okay, H m. This bag has seen better days for sure. I got these white Jean shorts, denim shorts, whatever you want to call it, and then 2 tops. This is legit a skims dupe. I need to do a full video on this. This tank top,. I mean, T-shirt is amazing. And then this tank top, which is really cute. It's giving coastal grandma with the white shorts. Aeropostale. I'm trying to fit this all in one part, but I don't think it's gonna happen. I got this bikini with matching bottoms. Looks like that. Super cute. And this. I am obsessed with this. It's like a romper that has a little cut out here. I need to make a part 2.

I mean, it's massive on me,. I look like a tent in it. but it's just for any of you that have been looking at it. this is a large. if I take the belt off, you will see,. I mean, it has pockets. it's really loose comfortable, but it's just massive. next cell item. I really like this as a jumpsuit. um, but I just don't feel very comfortable in it. it's quite thin, so it's showing everything, I think, but it's actually an okay length. so I'm 5'3 and I think this is a size large and it is loose here and here as well. but for the, I'd keep it if I was going on holiday and I could wear it on the beach, then I'd keep it, but I'm not, so this is the next dress. I ordered the satin version last time in the ZARA haul and that was so tight and I ordered it in the same size in the sale and this one is now too big. next out the sale is this dress I loved it online, ordered it, hate the colour of it. put it on, liked it, didn't like it, put it back on, liked it again and hung it up in my wardrobe. I love it, but I don't know if the color is too much the same. if that makes sense."
0,"Oh, my God, I love it. Oh, it feels so nice and, like, thick. Yes. Okay. Right. Love this. Love, love, love, love, love. Could I have gone a smaller size in this? Oh, I really don't know. Also, look at the nails. So cute. I mean, like, I'm probably not gonna zip it up. I'll probably always wear it like this. Oh, it's a bit big. Is it? Oh, for God's sake. I bet it's out of stock. Out of stock. Ugh. I want it in this color, too, but it's gonna be the same thing, so I ordered it in the same size. Oh, maybe I prefer it in the gray. I actually do that. Okay. I don't know. At the back here. Like, I would want it more in than that. Um, no, it. No, it makes me look huge. No, I need a smaller size. Well, this isn't going very well, is it? Next. I got this top, and immediately. Might be too short. It's definitely very tight. Jesus Christ. Oh, no. I don't know about this one. Top look. No. So this is going horribly. Last thing I got was jeans. They're based on fact. I know. Crack up. No, I'm raging. Do they fit? Yeah. Am I allowed to eat in these? No. What are these? These jeans are actually nice. Just don't fit right. They're not high waisted enough. Um, they're just tight and, like, you can't. Can't move your legs, and, um. No, no, no. I'm so annoyed. So that's what I ordered. Not one thing fits me and it all has to go back. Love that for me. I do think I will see if I get in the jacket and an extra small and see what it's like. And then the jeans. I don't know. I don't know what to do with jeans. I'll have a think about it, but at the minute I'm just raging. Anyway, I hope you have a better day than I'm having. Bye."
0,"So, I know that Zara has been taking some heat recently for their most recent campaign, and I mean, I think it's well deserved, but anywho, this video is not about that. I'm here to talk about how, well, it's more of a question, really: Why were we shopping at Zara to begin with? How do you guys find things to even buy at Zara? Because I've gone to Zara multiple times trying to like it, and I never find anything that I like. Here in Denver, well, in the Denver metro area, we only have one, and the one that we do have is two floors. So, they legitimately have racks on racks on racks of clothes, and I never seem to find anything. Their clothes are mediocre at best, and if that was the only problem, I could get on board with mediocre. I'm pretty sure half my closet is, but it's expensive, so expensive. So not only do I have to search through all the racks to find something that I medium like, but it's also expensive. I prefer HM because they're, listen, listen, I know, I know, listen, uh, they both sell fast fashion obviously, but at HM, it's so much cheaper. So, they sell the same things, but it's cheaper at HM, right? So, I don't know, maybe it's me. I'm the problem, it's me. Just let me know. I can't be the only one that feels this way."
-1,"so immediately after I finished filming that last video about unboxing the stuff I bought and showing off my brand new little pink tracksuit from Zara,. I put my hand in the pocket only to find there's just a giant hole in here. it was never sewn together, so it's just a huge hole, so that's great. like I said,. I've literally never bought anything from Zara before. this is my first time ever purchasing. is that usual?"
-1,"Okay, story time. I'm literally the kind of person that everyone says ""that would only happen to you."" So, my friend invited me to this Variety magazine event that was honoring a bunch of empowering famous females, like Amanda Seyfried, Queen Latifah. And anyways, I was wearing this really cute dress, right? Let me show you. Hey, like, look how pretty, it's from Zara. So that was my first mistake. Like, look how pretty the side was, Camila Cabello. I saw you double-take that. So cute, but I'm just chilling, sitting there drinking my unlimited wine, five-course dinner, when my friend's phone drops. And I'm frantically helping her find it, bent down in weird positions, when all of a sudden... Literally, my friend was able to fix it one time. And then, of course, it started fidgeting, and right as we're gonna walk out... Don't wear Zara to a nice event, hmm."
-1,"Hey, girls, I ordered a bunch of denim in from Zara because I feel like everybody raves about the Zara jeans. You can tell for me, they were absolutely terrible. Way too big in the waist. Now, if you're curvy like me,. I shared an entire YouTube video haul where I share all my favorite denim styles and denim brands. You can access that video link in bio."
-1,I can put them over my Poshmark I'm so upset like the waist is actually a little bad. I got this really cute satin bomber. I think not maybe the 4 will work this time so if you're like the size 2 and you don't have much of a booty because a lot of the Sarah that I thrifted from Salvation Army didn't get that let me show you the one other thing technically they should fit right I don't. I'm gonna use like this discount code that I have. I've gotten a 6 in because they're the height it's like a blush pink my butt like my butt cheeks are down here they're long comfy she's really cute remember the 2 maybe a 0. I love it but I'm so sad about the pants um I'm so sad right I feel like. I'm so excited to get these and I mold you knew I was gonna return this one dress I got and then get these pants. Zara has been messed up right it is like lengthened my butt so let me know if you want them to go on my Poshmark or something right but Za my last call like this is gonna be great for like dresses and you want to buy these for me do you think where did my buck go. I was looking for like a baggy oversized cute kind of fit maybe I'm crazy these are so tight in the thigh and I feel like I can't even stretch them because I'll rip them. I'm shocked that I got these zipped it was like 4 bucks you think they look like a fit maybe not. I mold them all the mold over whether to get the 6 before. I can't believe this has made my butt disappear we have another set up order
-1,"ou can enter your measurements, this is what I wanted okay, and that's just how it's supposed to be the end. A lot of women face these issues when purchasing clothes; it's much too big for her, and it's much too big of a hassle to honestly return it. So this is why we have the option to custom-make your dress, especially online when they can't try the clothes on. We all know that this type of effect does not look good on anybody; it's a no. And we cannot forget about the bust as you can see. So what can we do in situations like this? Causing the natural waistline of the dress to scrunch up and in addition to this, the best-case scenario would be to take it to a tailor which would require major, and this is what I got sadly. This is exactly why we added a custom option to our website because we know that, and not enough big on the hips, major reconstruction of the dress are very taught, and then we make the dress according to those exact measurements. Especially if you are a woman that does not fit the standard, which Newsflash is literally everyone that's not a working model, which is not flattering at all, girls. Give it to a friend, interesting that the hips, so first we notice this crunching over here at the waist, especially if the fabric is satin or silk satin. Size chart measurements, because we all deserve to wear clothing that fits nicely, which causes this bulk of fabric over here, and to even lose money in the process. And the problem here is that it's too big on the bust, you can see that the hips do not. So let's see all of the issues of this dress right here together, this is the pastels. Sadly, this happens and will continue to happen, worst-case scenario donates it, this is because the torso is much too long for her body type."
-1,"So the fact that you guys can reship it, the fact that you guys can add a credit to my account or expedite a replacement even though it's in stock cause allegedly you don't have it even though I see it on the app is not okay?

If you don't get to know,. I love. Again, acting decisive. Look at the same thing every single time, and I just love it. Yeah. Coke Zero. There you go. I got four tenders. Yum. Vicky got three chicken wings. This was 5. 5, guys. 5. She's just enjoying her food. Just came. She's so shy. Yeah, but we literally demolished it. We demolished it. It was so nice. Um, but, yeah, here's Vicky telling me to take a video of burning them. Like, we don't really know what it looks like, but here you go, guys. And, yeah, but the first place we went to was Morphe, because Vicky wanted a lip liner, and I told her she needs to get this, because if you don't know, you get to know. These are my favourite two lip liners. The next stop, we went to HM, so wanted to see what the hype was about, because I've been seeing it all over TikTok. Yeah, this is cute. Love that. This is also cute. We love her. This giving cats, like,. I'm not a vibe. Not a vibe, but whatever. But unfortunately,. I could not find a thing, so I didn't buy anything, so we just left the shop. Next up was Zara. We love a good Zara entrance. Let's have a look in there. The first thing I saw. Absolutely stunning. Love the colours. This is Vicky being indecisive about what jeans she should get. Um. I don't know, girl. You. Do you. You know. But this jacket was so cute. Is that what they're called? I'm not sure, but this was giving, like, my dad was at work for 10 hours. The colour of it. Not too keen on that. So we actually went upstairs to go and see the rest of the floor. This is cute. I actually like this, surprisingly. Absolutely love to this. This is a bit of me. Again. This is a bit of me. Skins. Jew. We love her. Ignore the makeup stains, if you know. You know, with those girls trying clothes on. Then we went to Primark to go and see what Primark was about. See this? Yeah. If you're a gardener, this is for you. Hons, this is for you. Then. Preceding Disney. If you're going Florida anytime soon, these clothes are for you. There. There you are at Primark. Bobby, Round you. Absolutely love this. We went upstairs because, listen, I love. I love the pyjamas. I actually do. If you're going to Birmingham, shoot these shoes. Good luck, too, because, listen, my feet would kill Vicky. Absolutely love this bag. I wasn't keen on it, though. Apple. I actually do love the colours in there. I love this. I love this coat. So nice. Again. If you're a gardener, this is for you, this jacket. But really, we went there for the pajamas cause so cute. Absolutely love this. But then again, my bum cheeks would just be hanging out of it, so I'm also just getting knickers. Wasn't really too keen on this, looked a bit cheap. But we love the absolute bralettes that they give in robes and snuggles. Uh, it's Christmas time. It's Christmas! You gotta go get these guys. But if you feeling extra sexy, the Saturn range. So cute. But the next place we went was lush, because if anyone knows me, lush is my favourite shop. And they just had absolutely everything. They even had Snow Fairy in already, so that was just 10 10. Listen, uh,. I'd get that right now. I absolutely love it. Put it in my bag. Let's go. Snow Fairy range is on the shelves, guys. And they've even got gift. Gift boxes. Oh my God! Perfect gift for Christmas. And listen, let me just tell you,. I was a happy girl leaving the shop."
0,"A bunch of stuff was put on my body in Zara and this is how it looked. The first one was absolutely tragic. This was an absolute fuck no. The second one. I love this style. I hated this pattern. I don't know what it was about it. Stick a fork in my lemon. I am done. This is giving Positano. It's giving euro, it's giving Greek island. I wanna be buried in this jumpsuit. I tried the size up just to see was not it. If I was in Europe, this baby would have come with me. However, I'm not. I'm a pauper. I'm in Melbourne. Um, this one definitely not. I don't know what it was giving but it was given hessian sack with flower print. This is giving my ya yas closets nighty. Um, and where this look can kinda look cute in some instances, it was not cute in this instance. Okay. No did nothing for me. Um, I don't know what is wrong with Zara's pants sizes. Every time I get a pair of pants they either gaping it the waist or they're like too fucking tight at the crotch. But these could be cute if they fit you know that's it guys."
0,"I remember thinking she could beat me, but she cannot beat my outfit"
-1,"So I went to Zara today, and I just, like, either really hit at Zara or really miss. I tried on 17 things and I didn't leave with one thing. And I think it's because I'm a 5 one American girl and the clothes are not made for me. But anyways, everything I tried on was super cute. I wish it all fit, but it did not. So I'm just gonna share what I tried on and then how it looked on me. I hope it will look better on you."
1,"Zara summer haul. I love this score, but it was a size medium so it definitely had a lot of room in there, so I was hoping to find it in a small so I could size down. Found it was an extra small and that was too small. And then I tried on this gorgeous jacket which is similar colour, absolutely loved it. I absolutely love this one too. I didn't buy either of them but I kind of regret not buying the green cause I actually love it. Love these linen style trousers. Kind of wish I bought them but again like the HM ones, a little bit see through. I always find this style trousers. This top actually was just in my changing room. I just tried it on and I loved it so I bought it. Here's the skirt in a size small. Still has a lot of room around the waist, but much more comfortable to sit down in than the extra small, so I went for the small instead. And here's the shorts underneath."

0,"How you can work in Zara,. Bershka,. Pull  Bear and more for those who do not know that I did not know when I had arrived here in Spain is that it is all one and the same brand that is Inditex the same company for everyone has all these brands When working in any of them you have to apply for. Inditex you can not apply by individual brand Let's see it's super easy. You go to Inditex pinbombam somewhere it must tell you eh work with us, fill out your resume, they will ask you a couple of questions Pumba Go to if they call you to the interview that they usually call everyone, you have a group interview in my case it was virtual in which first each one is presented. I knew I was going to be touched First start mine I kind of said hello I have rebueno English that would be good for the center I said I'm not going to go to a town once I come to Barcelona. And nothing I was normal loose type as I am here on TikTok and type same presents each one and then they make you do as a group activity in which we at least had to decide as three clothing trends. They also ask you why you want to enter inditextos? Because I love the brand I love fashion or something is not thrown Type I want to work in the summer I want money no idea. Well in this group interview they more or less see what role you have If you have a Leader role if you don't talk shit If you didn't collaborate if you just cause this problem. I mean they go see Me 4 hours into that call type they called me and told me tomorrow you can start. And me mm yes in Pull Ah because I forgot a part. They ask you At least I was asked in the interview I know there are people who didn't ask you They tell you good type what are your favorite brands? And me I mean I was nervous no idea I said Pull Bershka and Zara because I was afraid that everyone says did you see that at Zara you work too much? So I said I'm not going to say it first and I had like a friend who worked in pool so maybe we'll be in the same pool And well I got pool but another two blocks but Bershka ponele I really like the clothes but well what do I know The truth is that all the Bershka pools I saw mine is the one where they do the most things I mean I go to the other places and I don't see them or moving In my store they are all running around asshole. So basically there they send you 400 contracts that you sign online type great. You start? I haven't gotten paid yet. I should have been paid today, but I don't know they told me that the new ones get paid next week. No idea. I do. Mm I need to buy stuff at the grocery store, you know? Well, if you want me to tell you a video How more first day type, more comfortable stuff, the work one or more specific type stuff,. Half more boring,. I can do another TikTok video. Or I can do a long one,. I don't know, on YouTube if you want, with all the questions you have. But the truth is that it goes up super easy. All the people I know what type,. I apply for Inditex, got in and you have a trial period more or less than 30 days that they can throw you out until the 30th. The truth is that you have to be very stupid. I mean, it's very noticeable the difference between the one who is new normal and the one who is new who doesn't know. Basically you have to teach him to walk from scratch. Yes it's good. Like a first job. It's cool."
0,"Something weird happened to me from Zara while I was in the dressing room and discovered a new secret. If you don't know this trick you risk paying extra money at the cash register. Unknowingly. A few days ago I was at Zara when I found the same item in 2 different prices how was it possible that the same dress cost differently it was not a printing error on the tag, but I discovered a secret explanation that can be a key trick before telling you what happened follow me for shopping secrets and other similar videos. Have you ever noticed a colored line on Zara's tags? 1 of the 2 dresses had the tag with a red line red line equal price valid in Spain, in other countries but not in Italy the other dress instead had the tag with the line Blue line equal price valid in Italy. But wait 2 reasons why this information number 1 is important, when you are in the store check that there is a blue line on the card or you will pay more at checkout number 2. Knowing this can be the turning point when you are outside Italy if you are from Zara abroad and you find the Blue line on the tags means that Zara Costa as in Italy if you are abroad and you find a red line on the tags means that you should buy because you are saving money if there is no line it is not convenient. Don't miss the next secret."

1,"The Zara sales are the question I keep getting these days and don't worry,. I'm going to solve it. January sales are always on the same date, only this year it falls on Sunday. They start on the 6th on the web and on the 7th in store. Time on the web is really usually about 8 or 9 to make baskets On day 5. Okay, on Friday Day 5 we can start making your baskets. Don't worry,. I'll let you know, tell me about all the sales. When it's time to go online to buy when the sales have already started, your cart is empty. Sometimes they empty the baskets. So I recommend that the day the sales start you add everything to the Wish list in case you empty the basket that you can add quickly. And don't lose products. Discounts Remember that shipping costs are charged, if you place 1 order for 300 of discounts you will still be charged shipping costs. Unless you have 1 seasonal item worth 30 that sometimes you have no choice but because I don't know if you know, but the stores reach 1 limit of orders. The free in-store pick-up is limited to 1 limit because there is no more room for orders and you have to pay shipping costs. The sales start and you see that something is sold out, nothing happens, keep looking during all the sales because then there are many refunds that are uploaded to virtual showcase and will let you buy it. And of course the sales are wonderful because there are many sales, that is, they are going down week by week, not all items, there are some that go down every 2 weeks but there ares. And in the last sales I have achieved a lot of things. If you have any questions about Zara, you know where I am."

0,"Raise your hand if you set out on a journey but never made it to your proposed destination. This was me on this day. All I wanted was to get to the. Zara shop at the Metro Centre from Newcastle to buy the one jacket that was sold at on the Zara website. It was hard enough getting to town because of the road repairs, but tell me why the go not is boss has to go on strike on this particular day? And why are there always road repairs going on on these English roads? Or is it Newcastle only? Actually the real question is why are there never road repairs or constructions going on in my beloved Nigeria? Hmm. Anyways, I digress. As I couldn't get to. Zara shop to get the code that I really wanted,. I went shopping for other options. I wanted to try HM but I did go to the nest first. I tried out a jumper as I told the black and white contrast looked good and then a jacket but I didn't like them on. Nest was a feel and so was HM. The jacket looked ridiculous on me. It was so puffy. See me bits in my chest. I decided to check Zara online one more time. Maybe local be on my side and it was just. Literally bought it. Just but as my sisters. God is faith. Indeed. That was the quickest check out I've ever done. I know it's Cliche. But you see, life, it gave me lemons, but also gave me lemonade. Because I didn't give up."

1,"Yay! My Shein order arrived and let's show you what I got. Yes, I'm doing a voice over because when I recorded it, it did not pick up any sounds. So here it is. First off, we have this fluffy brown jumper hoodie with the pockets, has cute little bear ears on the hood. I absolutely love this and it's super, super warm and super soft. Next I got this along T-shirt. I did think it was a jumper when I paid for it, but clearly did not read the description properly, but absolutely love it. Then I got this stripy top, and I'd not normally wear fitted long sleeve tops, but I absolutely love this and I just hopefully I can lose that, you know, belly pouch that's going on. Next was this other hoodie that I absolutely loved, a zip, and I love that it's like knitted. It is a little bit thin, but it's still very warm to wear. Next I got this other hoodie. It's super, super soft and fluffy, has a hood and I wish it had pockets, but apart from that, I absolutely love it. And look at the gorgeous design. Next I got this tracksuit set. Absolutely love it. Wish it had pockets, but apart from that, it's super warm. I have to have it really high up on my belly because I'm super short, but apart from that, I love it. Keeping it. Next I got some black leggings and I want To return them. So someone can let me know how to return them, that would be great. They are too loose. Too loose, too saggy. Not fitted at all. And then I got some jeans. I'm okay with these jeans. I normally have it more fitted around the legs, but I love them. They fit perfectly. And I'm definitely keeping these ones. So if you liked my Shein Haul, stick around, because I have done another 2 orders, some with kids clothes. But yeah, make sure you follow me."
0,"I bought pants on she in. Buying pants for me is really hard because I'm little, um, but my legs are really long for how little my waist is, so pants are always too short on me. these look a little long. I was like, fck. Yeah, they're gonna fit. Great, right? Not too short, so. I guess that's nice. Let's try them on. Okay? First thought, yes, yes, yes. Then we back up. What? Hold on. Let me. what the fuck she in? Sorry I were bad. They're per stacking, but they don't come stacked, so i'm supposed to do this and wear them like that. But why? Why she in? Why? Why would I do that?"

I'm gonna have a little time. this top is so much better. so much longer. length is still slightly short at the back. but I don't really mind. yeah. again, 3xl was cute. another top in a similar styles. little same styles. last one. this one for some reason is actually longer. which is perfectly. this is the, like, the perfect fit for me. and yeah, yeah, all three xl. I'm obsessed with this one now. I've been on the top and looking for top. like, this everywhere. I have not find one that actually like, an obsessed. again. crop top. but like, comes much longer. like, comes like, I'm gonna tuck my jeans. I'm obsessed. if you put in a free color. I like, absolutely love it. okay. this top is like, the best. I ordered it because I'm too old just color and I'm obsessed. it's a lemon tucker. so you can see how long it is. it's him, like, reasonable length. I would never waited, like, untalked, but, and it's like, sort of a, like, high material, but like, I like it. I put some back on just so I can show you this card again, just so cute and so I got this in a two xl, cause it's only hard and it like, it fits like, it's fine. not average, but not, but, and I have no idea stops apparently someone from by some, like, a white vest of underneath. and these jeans think it'd be cute and it's definitely not, like, winter material, but like, it'll be nice for, like, like,. I'm gonna hold this the time. but I still have like, and like, at night or something. okay, next is these and cooper shorts, which were my biggest concern actually when I ordered. I feel really short or like, really thin and like, they feel thin, but like, they're not see through and which is good cause like, they're light and they're like, a little bit baggy, but and I probably gonna size down cause of all the room, but they're comfortable, so it's fine. and yeah, three xl. I have 6 seconds. this is the last dress and three xl"

It's a lovely dress, don't get me wrong, Bush. I mean, no. What story. Like, it looks like. It just looks so weird, doesn't it? Here. I think they filled the whole thing up."
-1,okay so I got this cute outfit it's like really cute right kind of like carol baskin vibes you know um now haha when you move down the ankles you can't see because there's a footprint in the way but if I go this way you'll notice that one side is right down to my ankle and the other fuck I pulled this my feet but like um it is complete there's no bunching whatsoever um it's short I don't know what to do this is so weird
-1,I just wanted you to laugh at me. I ordered this stupid fucking thing from Shein. What the fuck is this? I can't

0,"Let's try on this suit for Shein that I think is not going to fit me. So they do loads of different colors. It's waist goes, shorts extra large. I'm being hopeful, Bush. You know, they look small. What are you thinking, lads? Fits so good, doesn't it? What? Story of the top. Like a Billy chops. Like I can actually fits me, Bush. The shorts going back legs,. I'm afraid, unless I take out a bit of liposuction. Could the money stretch to that, lads"
-1,"Okay, here it is. So I thought I was gonna really eat down with this dress, but, um, no, I. I was gonna get a mask that match this, have, like, little furry fuzzies around the rim of the mask, you know, and I was gonna look so cute. Um, but it's almost as if it's, like, equivalent to, like, taking a track. It is kind of gluing it. And you ever see, like, we see the track that's glued there, but, um, you know, if that's you, that's you. But I'm not that girly, so I don't like my track showing. I kind of, like, you know, just. It was too much. But, yeah, I mean, I got what I paid for. Now I gotta spend the rest of the day trying to find a new outfit."

0,"Hey, guys. So. I wanted to do a little outfit check in Amazon. Sheen and boots from Amazon. So have a good night."
-1,"Right. You've only just gone and asked me when. I've just put me. I'm ready for going out. So this is the hair code. TikTok shop topper. And I've put it on the side. Straighten my hair today. First time I've used it straight. So I'll take it off for you. Three clips. 1, two, three. Right. So that is the TikTok shop one. Bear with. Right. This is a Shein one. This was the more expensive of the two. Right. So I've straightened my hair. So I don't know what this is gonna look like. I've done it to the sensor. Clip, clip, clip. This one isn't as bad as the other. Now let's see if I can straighten it. Probably my choice because I think you look better when you've got like. That one's got Bella's roots already showing, so it looks more natural. This looks more fake to me. The next one. You gonna shit yourself? Not shit yourself. You piss yourself. No, no. Don't like that. It just looks too fake there. Some might say it's alright. I don't like it, so that's a shame. One. I could probably make it look better, but I ain't got time tonight. Now this one, please. I don't know. Right. The two clips go at the front on all the others. So that's what I'm gonna do. What the hell is this? When I said it like Rod Stewart, I wasn't lying. Mean, what the hell am I supposed To do with this. What is it? Like a cockatoo? What the fuck is going on? The clips don't clip properly. It's just rising up. That's too bulky. Can you imagine me going out tonight like that? That is ridiculous. Don't bother. You get what you pay for. Right? So that is shit that's going in the bed. I'm gonna put the hair code 1 back on. Good old faithful note. It's brown. So my roots. That's what my roots are like. But my roots are literally grey as well. So I shall put it on the side again where had it before. If you don't clip it on tight first time, you can always go back to it. It's not a problem. I've just washed this. Not quite tight enough. There. Now what you think? That's better, isn't it? Not just me because I'm selling them. You don't have to buy it off me. Can go. Go to hair code. Actually follow them. Go on their lives cause they do offers on the lives. It's about hundred pound at the moment, but they do reduce into half price and you get all different colours. But yeah, that's me for tonight. Thank you for making me do that. That one. Rod stew, eat your hearts out. That one's acceptable. That's an emergency one, but that's about it for me. So machine ones come in a box like that? Not for me, I'm afraid."
-1,"hey, babes, my name is Annalise, and I buy the world's weirdest clothing items so that you don't have to. recently, I uploaded a YouTube video where I bought the weirdest clothing items on Shein. and one of those items was this Y2K top. it's literally a bit of fur with a belt on it. so let's put this on. this is what the top looks like on. so this is the front and this is the back. and you cannot tell me that this looks good. I just wanna know went through shein's head when they designed this, because not only is it super weird, my boobs are about to bust out at any second because this belt is really pushing them up and out, and not in a good way. so it's definitely one of the weirdest items on Shein, that's for sure."
0,"hey, babes, my name is Annalise, and I buy the world's weirdest clothing items so that you don't have to. and recently,. I bought the weirdest clothing items on Yes. Style for a YouTube video. and let me show y'all one of the tops that I got. this is the top. it is this beautiful pink color. but what is going on with these hands? let's put it on. it's like. this is what the top looks like on a super gorgeous, super stunning. I just don't understand the hands. what is going on here? if it's meant to be saucy and, like, look really sexy grabbing you, it does not do that. it does not do that. who is buying this? I mean, me, obviously, but who is buying this to wear? it's so weird. I can't."
1,okay so I saw this little dress it's super cute right here's another view cute little hip thing going on
0,"The viral tights just got a bit better, so got these and sheen. Um, they went not the last time. So basically, they're fleece lined. Bosh, they look like they're fine denier tights, but these ones have little polka dots on them, so I got them in Shein. I'll tag them at the end of the video. Let's try them on and see what they're like. I feel like a hooker. I'm just not feeling them. I don't know. I don't know what you think."
0,"hey, girl. welcome back. so today I have for you is a Shein haul. starting off with this green bathing suit. I really like this. at first when I tried it on, I didn't like it, but, girl, now I'm looking at it,. I look good. okay, um, so then it's just, like, a little tie in the back, so you can tie it, like, tight or loose, however you want it. I think it's super cute. this one I really don't like because I feel like my top area is too big for this, and I don't like spillage, and it's covering my bottoms too much. I like to show a little bit cheek. okay. I like to show a little bit cheek. so then I got, um, this hat in these shades, y'all. this hat stuck it. the smell was atrocious. I had to throw it out immediately. um, but then just a little close up on the shades. y'all see the green on green, girl? yeah. imagine the pictures. hmm. okay. so then I got this shirt and then these biker shorts that came in a pack of 3, which was gray, dark gray, and black. then I got this shirt. I also have it in brown, but had to reorder it because it ripped. I got this bag. it's cute. I mean, you know. but then I got this tote. I think it's really cute. it reminds me of the. that heart on those Converses. I don't know what they call, but yeah. okay. bye, girl."
0,"Hey, so um, I wanted to make a response video to you all. Um. Y'all are so funny. I have been dying at the comments since I posted it like this two days ago. Um, but goodness gracious. So y'all, I bought that dress for a party that I'm supposed to be going to, uh, tomorrow. And um, your comments further confirmed why I refuse to put on that dress. Cause the way that Chuck clowned and joked in that dress just kind of shows me I made the right decision. I'm not putting it on. So all the requests of hey, put it on, put it on! I'm not doing all that. I'm sorry. You know, you just have to use your imagination. Um. What else I wanted to say here? So I'm out of town, so I don't have the dress with me right now. Um, however, I will post a picture of what the dress actually look like. I want another one. Cause I really don't really be on TikTok for real like that, so I don't really know how to use them use this app other than I just get on um, after work, after I eat or whatever, and I just look,. I'm only here for a few laughs, but that's it. So, um. Well, I will say this to be fair. To be fair,. I did not do my due diligence in zooming in on the dress. Uh, cause it's kind of accurate to What the website says. I was looking for something. I'm going to, like, a masquerade, little party, and I was looking for a dress that kind of match that thing. So I had a little mask that was gonna match a little. I thought it was feathers, but, you know, my fault. I should have read. I should have zoomed in and realize that Shane literally sold on tracks. So, I mean, when I post it, you're gonna say, well, sis, you got what you got. And that's fair. I got what I got. But the fact that they are selling dresses with a sewed on track is. I mean, it's beyond me. And another question I keep getting asked is if I'm gonna return the dress. No, I actually wanna keep this for memories, cause I think this is pretty funny. And plus, I wanna show my family when I go visit them for Christmas, so I want them to see, um, the travesty that arrived in my mail. And I apologize for the delayed response, y'all. Um, all these people in my inbox, a little bit overwhelming. I'm like, okay,. I'm not used to this. I kind of, uh. I come to TikTok to escape, you know? Um,. I'm a therapist, and I travel a lot, and I'm just really busy. And so, yes,. I still am working on some of my unhealthing, escaping coping mechanisms. But, you know, we celebrate growth. Amen. Yeah. Growing, learning, evolving. I Am where I am,. I don't really, you know, I'm not gonna beat myself up over it, so. But since I got your attention,. I wanna put my friends on because I ain't a content creator for real, um, but I know some real good ones. And so I'm going to link them to this, um, video, and please go give them a follow so them show them some support. There's some really great black women. I love and support. I've known for years. And so other than that, y'all thank y'all for your. The laughs, the. Y'all just. Y'all really blessed me with this one, so. Yeah. Bye."
-1,"I don't really have time for this cause I'm running late. But I'm committed to my content. So people, another shame piece of. This one is good paper mache. Okay, so I do not recommend this. 0 out of 5 stars. I don't even know why this strap is different from this strap. I don't know what this was trying to do. A little asymmetrical thing, but I think supposed to be straight across. It's not um. It's very thin. That's okay for me. Don't recommend it for everybody. Uh, the sleet is. We're not doing no full body on this. This is the. Catch me if you can. If you see me outside on this, you saw it. If you don't, you wasn't supposed to. I also got on the cheap pair of sheen piece of heel. They already leaving the rocket so it doesn't be on the floor somewhere. It's because my 11 dollar shoes broke these earrings of dollar. I had to put Neosporin and Vaseline on them. So I don't work out at hives, but that's what I got home. I hope you like it. And if you do, please don't buy it. Cause this is the one. In time. Like after I say this out the night, there's. There's. There's no way I could put it back on."
-1,I did not expect to look like farmer john when I went out in this outfit tonight but I do so there's that sorry if you saw me
0,"God, I was getting cute shorts to wear for the Travis. Scott concert on Friday. Oh, my god. I guess. I guess they run big. I guess so. Like, bro, like, they're so."
-1,homes i just got a she in package and we need to talk about this haha okay here's what i love about this garment love hate first off these are thinner than shoe strings like these these would rip off so fast they are so thin and then can we talk about the ring in the middle it is a keychain full on keychain i just she in man you can't make this up
-1,"Okay, now I think I see why they said don't buy bathing suits from Shein. This is my favorite one. It's so cute. And I just took it out of the dryer, and it's no longer in use. I'm so sad right now. Also, literally, how does that happen? How?"
0,"this is me once again doing a Shein haul. so this is the first outfit and shoes. I think the shoes are really cute. I can guarantee you they're not gonna be very comfortable, but for the aesthetic,. I'll give them, like, a solid 7 and 12. uh, this is super cute. uh, it fits pretty well. uh, i'mma give this a solid 9 out of 10. it's pretty cute. I'm upset. this has so much potential, but, like, the boob cup doesn't work. like, it's just, like, a little band. even if you have, like, small boobs. like, I don't know how this would work for you. uh, and the skirt. oh, my God. like it. I've tried it on both ways in case it had it backwards, and it just fits. it's just wrong. like, 3 out of 10 and, like, 0 out of 10. I'm. I'm upset. this top is so cute. I normally can't find tops that, like, actually fit me and hold my boobs in, so this is really cute. is giving me, like, a little fairy moment. like, the back is cute. I really like this. I'm gonna go, like, a solid. let's give it a 8 out of 10. so shein's not doing too good this time. literally, this is so cheap. it looks so bad. and I bought it into color, so I just wasted money, cause this is. this is not good. this is. it's bad. it's just very boring. um, it's very boring, and it's, like, dangerously close to exposing things that. I don't necessarily wanna expose. uh, yeah. okay. I had to take a break from that because I was getting really irritated. but, like, look how cute is this? makes me a little bit happier about wasting a lot of money. so it's definitely not great. uh, but it's. it's better. it's better. and it's, uh, certainly kind of makes up for how terrible everything else has been. so, yeah."

0,hello I need help deciding what to wear to a wedding. I need everybody's opinion because I do need constant validation in every area of my life three requirements for this dress. I need to be able to drop it low on the dance floor it needs to have room for my pouch as I eat throughout the night and. I don't know if I'll get banned for saying this but I want to wear undergarments that are comfortable so I don't want any lines if I decide to wear some granini paninis these are all from shein shine what however you say it and I'll post the screenshot so here's No.1 okay don't know I feel like I'm immediately going to have sweat stains. I like the color. I can definitely drop it low in this it has room to expand but this material might show lines not sure steven what do you rate this out of 10 he's just gonna say 10 for every single one moving on alright No.2 we got a little red action okay we love to see it not bad got the one shoulder going on we got this little detail here. I feel like a flamenco dancer the issue though. I don't know how much room I have to expand comfortably here and I'm not gonna show you but I think you can see lines but yes. No.2. I already took it off but steven what do you rate the red one 11 moving on to No.3 slinky. I feel like I'm in a club in like 2003 just not sure that the slink is for me steven what do you rate it nine number four. I think. I feel like I look too much like a bridesmaid. I guess I was just feeling the one shoulders when I ordered this steven what's your rating nine had to get some navy blue in here this one is somehow too tight but also not giving me any shape steven actually just zipped my skin into it so I'm gonna veto this one what you rate it steven eight which translates to like two lastly yet another one shoulder moment y'all. I'm sorry to have just realized that it's better with only this light but I really don't feel like trying all of them back on feeling myself in this one what's your rating 10 tell me what you guys think

I don't know but look at the back okay I've shown you this one before but um you know just thought it deserved its own little spot here in the fail video this thing is horrible. I fucking hate it it's stupid sheen what the fuck okay so this one there's nothing wrong with the dress it is me it is my anatomy doesn't fill it out very well so it's not the dresses fault otherwise this one had put
-1,I find it so terrifying that there is so much fake dynamic tattooing for sale on Shein. And look at all of these reviews. People are actually using it on people. And clients don't buy a ring from Shein.
0,"Hi guys, well I almost don't do this kind of videos, but I have uh, the curiosity because I just got the leggings that I see that many girls wear them and that they look a colototota because of the type of leggings it is. So I already want to measure them and let's see. Um, yes, yes it is true that they have that effect. Look,. I already took it off. I ordered them in this color. See how it has there like the buttock jumped and the truth is m and I see it half small. Hey friends,. I don't know,. I mean I like it but at the same time I feel like it's kind of very muddy and you look like a giant tail. But because it's like the whole dog stuck in there. See,. I mean,. I don't know, ha ha. I mean if you put yourself in the pose that the girl puts on it does look good, but I don't know if I want the tail to be so noticeable like that."
-1,"okay guys, so I ordered like a month or 2 ago on Shein or Shein however you say it, some cute cow print towels. like so I got this little hand towel and then 2 regular size towels to hang up in our guest bathroom. now they look pretty worn on the side as you can see. and that is because I've washed them 10 times, like time after time, like in a row because they smell so bad. and when I first open the package. I didn't notice a scent. and then it was after a few weeks. I noticed a scent in our hallway. I couldn't tell if it was coming from the bathroom or the hallway. and we had a huge like, like bad freezing storm. so our cat was in the house and we thought our cat had an accident somewhere in the house. we can't find where it is. I was literally on my hands and knees sniffing the carpets trying to find out where this cat pee was cause it smells like cat pee. and finally I just grab the towels, sniff them after searching for like a week, and it was the towels. these towels smell like cat pee. really random, really gross. so I wash them, they still stink. and like I said,. I wash them about 10 times. they don't smell as bad as they did before, but they still stink. so I don't know. sheen like what is up with that. I guess I'm just gonna throw these towels away."
-1,so I bought myself a new handbag from shein. I needed one for the summer it's come it's like a doll's handbag like what am I supposed to do with that look at the size of it like I wouldn't even fit my phone in there it's like a child's handbag and it smells like fish
0,"Now, we all love a bit of Shein, right? Few bikinis and all your summer stuff. But does anyone else end up on this weird side of Shein? Because I wanna know how I got here. Bucking chicken helmets. Who the fuck looked at chicken and thought, you know what that means? A fucking helmet? And for the softer chickens, you know, the fashionistas. How did I end up here? One minute I'm looking at bikinis and cover UPS, and the next I'm admiring chickens for their hats. This. Does anyone else. Does this happen to anyone else in Shein or"

This looks big, but it's the size small. Like, you tuck it in with some jeans. Then I got this cropped, like, ribbed top. Then I got it in this color. Oh, my gosh, y'all. I literally realized that I got this 2 times. It's very cute. Oh. Oh, no, I don't like that. Well, I got that 1 2 times, so someone wants one, message me. And I did that with this shirt also. This looks like a pajama shirt. Don't know if I'll be wearing that. Yo, this shirt looks huge, but it's a size small. What? Okay, then I got these. Mom. Jeans. I just realized that both of those pairs were supposed to be skinny jeans. What is that? They're supposed to be mom. I mean, skinny jeans and their mom jeans. Like, what's going on, y'all? I'm so upset. Same shirt again for the 3rd time. Okay, these look extremely tiny. Don't know if I'll be able to fit in those. What is this gonna cover? This is such a fail. These are big.

-1,"I want to start off by saying that this is the first time that I've received anything from Shein Broke. This is supposed to be a large glass mug, and it arrived broken. The package was a little bit banged up. It didn't have enough foam on the outside layer to protect it. And then the second thing that I received that was broke was my bento box for lunch. It arrived cracked. Everything else was pretty decent."
0,"So I ordered some shoes from Shein for my boyfriend's dog to try. So we're gonna put those on today. Here. The little crocs. I don't know if they'll fit on his feet, but we're gonna try.

I just tucked in the top cause I don't like it out. I'm keeping this. I cannot stop laughing. I only got this because I have a sequin theme party coming up. This is a hard no,. I. I'm gonna be returning this. From sequin to feathers. Woo! That dress. I will be returning that dress. Um, I like the style, but this part keeps flapping up. Maybe it's my hips, I don't know.

I want you to share with me your moline shopping fails to make you feel better
-1,"All right, well,. I have maternity pictures in about five hours, and I ordered my dress off of Shein, and I haven't even taken out the package, and I've had it for a couple weeks, so I'm gonna see what it looks like. It was only, like, 17 bucks, okay? So I'm very disappointed, but I'm still gonna wear it because this is my only option. So the dress is supposed to go on like this, and these are supposed to cover up my arms. However, I feel like when they sewed this part on, they sewed it on backwards, because the front, it's way longer than the back, and the front has the seam going all the way down the middle. So I definitely should look that for now. I've just never had this problem with Sheen. This is literally my only option, so we're just gonna have to make it work. But, like, let me show you. Like, that is the front, and that is the back, and the front has that. Where's the seam going? All the way down the middle."
-1,"Oh, I promise y'all. I know the same about books, but I'm so mad right now,. Shein. Y'all better catch all these. I waited 2 weeks, 2 whole weeks to get these little beauty sponges, and I thought I came up and I called my daughter and was like, oh, you missed out. I don't use this motherfucker coupon to get me 50 of these sponges to do my makeup for these book cover looks. I'm so bad. I want to cry right now because I'm so freaking bad. Why I play so much? Y'all know fucking well this ain't what y'all said I was getting. Oh! Oh, I hate it here, man. Let me show you all the difference, because I really don't think y'all understand what I thought I was getting. Like, in my head, in my motherfucking peripherals, I just saw, like,. Oh, I saw 50, Eddie, but she catch my favor for my mama late, bro. You don't piss me off, because this is what I thought I was getting, for real. So I thought I was getting a, you know, regular size sponge, and these bitches sent me 50 of those on my machine. You're gonna have to see me about this, because I really didn't even order my little paw paws, you feel me? I ain't gonna get no other sponge, because I was just bragging everybody about this room, the fucking coupon, and then you send me this shit. 50 of these motherfuckers. 50, bitch, what i'mma do with 50 instead of 50? I'm so mad, like,. I'm after laughs. They keep from crying because I was already having a bad day. I promise y'all,. I was already having a bad day. And if my son bought my package in here, the. I'm like, okay, was it this fucking all of it from telly? Yo, if she was the person, maybe in a ring. What the. I am having a mental breakdown,. Shein? That we had beef. That's all you had to say, bro? Cause you just went for the kill and you don't even know me. I fucking hate here. I really. I'm not worrying nothing else. Fuck yeah! Coupons up on my mama. Oh! Oh!"
-1,"I'm back to share another experience with you guys. You remember that Tammy made me buy those viral tie dye TikTok leggings, and I shared that experience with you guys. Well,. Vicky found these pants online that she thought that I should have, and so she sent me a picture with a link, and she's like, you should get these. These would be good for you. And I was like, um. Um, no, those would not look good on me, because I'm way too big for those pants. No. Well, Vicky disagreed with me, so much so that she ordered these pants for me and had them shipped to my house. So I got these pants today, and just for fun,. I'm gonna try them on for you guys, because I promise you,. Mickey, you were wrong about these pants. So give me just one second. Hold on. Okay, so I had to put a shirt on and open these pants. You guys, from the front, they look like normal pants, right? Okay, but the back. These are the back, so. All right, I'm gonna try these on just for you. Vicky. Vicky, I hate to be the one to say, I told you so, but I told you so. I'm way too big for these pants. Did I get them on? Yes. They look okay from the front. Okay, but there's a whole lot going on back here, so I'm just gonna show you real quick. Just real quick. Just because I promised to share this with TikTok, that's a little much. These are never leaving my house. But thank you for the gift, Vicky. I love you a bunch."
1,okay I don't usually make posts like this but I was window shopping on shein as one does and I had to share what I found 1st up we've got this one eat a ready cooked meal star gazy pie next we've got you can't avoid being yourself hi brand new me style is never wrong weekend inspiration next in this might be my favorite grapes so hot grapes juice summer sun very thirsty.

I'm passionate about pursuing impossible goals another good one fruit juice never say no opps very Nice fruit juice depends on whether the fruit is fresh and whatever this is
1,"Here. OMG, no way. Oh, my. Okay, so I thought this was gonna be a sequin dress. Oh, my gosh. And I almost didn't order it, but it's, like, less than 5, and, like, that's such a cute dress, even if she just wears it around the house now. She's definitely just gonna wear it around the house. So I thought it was full on full sequins with, like, tool. Oh, my gosh, you guys, that's a print. It's a print. Those are not sequins. But do they look like it? What do you guys think? Wow. I should read reviews."
-1,I will never buy a mirror on shine again.
-1,I was just window shopping on Shein and I had to stop immediately to show you guys how funny the photoshopping is on these models hold on like what is that come on who did that and also just this pose why why but like if you thought it couldn't get worse whos shaped like that you're not ready wait oh no no no she in
0,if this is not flat to me it just don't make the dress look as good as it is so we'll start with the shirt I have on right now so but like why do I need all the area who needs all of this crotch area in their pants why is it this tight they look weird you know no disclaimer I do love the skin stuff why is it all of this because if I pull them down. I can still wear these if I like rolling down and it's not looking as bad on camera as it is in person but like but here we go again like quality clothing to start trying because it just wasn't working for me the crotch is weird next these pants this is what I'm timing with the crotch so that's why I'm like I got to figure out like some better. I just don't like that the lower belly part can sometimes like they're cute you know whatever so yeah I guess it does make you like Snatch here to see him stress on time out you see them saying like they fit kind of cute but like what is that but yet again like I'm not making it up that stuff like if I'm having a bloated day that this looks big like if you have anything that like is not like perfect these pants are next why is it all this room but this is what I'm talking about make me look a little bit bigger than I want to this shirt is a large. I don't anything that's making me look worse you know this is a large shirt. I just had to show you how ridiculous some of that stuff fit it should you know it's pretty but I don't the shorts look cute okay you know cute cute cute. I am 5'4 like 154 pounds all right so let's let me show you how these shein sales that I'm talking about
-1,It almost feels like a thin rain jacket. It is so thin. So this jacket is terrible. I bought it so you don't have to and I do not recommend you buy it but I cannot stress enough how garbage this is. Ignore the bottom half of me. I don't know what's going on here okay thank you bye
0,"Shein's got some more explaining to do. I mean,. I was looking for a little photo album the other day for my nail decals. Like, just a tiny album. I could slip my little nail decals in. Um, just look at these. I mean, you hear me from far away? Cherry, Juicy Boo Boo, Bobo. This is the Cute Putty Beauty Guide. Super Hot Gourami. Cute Putty. This one just really threw me for a loop. Pieces of moment. Not sure what that even says, but. Pieces of moment. That's enough album. Please choose me. I don't know. I feel like there was, like, a company design competition, and it was supposed to just be album with the cow, but they were trying to lure the judges in. Or what else could it be? Black milk. So lovely. Collect book. Black milk. Black milk. This one is a lot. Meet you. Cake. Happy every day. You are like the night. Your silence is that of a star. As remote and candid with a stillness and constant. I don't know. One word. The same is enough. You are like my soul. I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal. I mean, that. That's. That's that one statement there that says a lot. Let me run that back for you. I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal. Seems like slim to none. No loyalty there. This one I can possibly see. A use for, like, if you're building your glutes, your growth, your growth profile. Peach Tea Party. I mean, I can. You could, like, maybe measure your glutes as you're working out. Growth record, maybe. I ordered this one. Mine. I like it. Just kidding. And last but not least, folks. Butterfly. I hope you're here for me. What's happening? What's happening here?"
-1,"Okay, guys, on behalf of the dance community and all dance teachers out there, never buy pointe shoes off of Shein, especially if your dance teacher has not approved of it. Let's talk about what's wrong with these shoes. First up, this price should be 90 at least because that's how expensive pointe shoes are. Second, look at that. I don't even know if that's moleskin or that's trying to be a some type of darning, but you don't buy countries like that. Third, check out the shoe itself. That is a crappy design. You should never go on point unless your dance teacher has given you approval, plain and simple. Last point, where can be dangerous, guys, it can lead to lifelong injury, lifelong deformities of your feet, all that sort of stuff. And you can 100 prevent this simply by following the orders of your ballet instructor. If she says no, you're not ready to go on point, you're not ready to go on point. You won't see me come on social media, get pissed off about a lot of things, but this really angers. Do you see that? US ballet instructors go to school for a really long time to make sure that your kids go on point. Safe parents, if you're watching, you need to trust that your dance teachers know what they're talking about when it's time to put your kids on point and when it's not dancers, you need to pay attention to your Dance teachers so you don't get injured. Trust the process. Trust your instructor."
1,okay so I probably deserve this for shopping at Shein but this is just too fucking funny so I got this shirt cocktail zodiac. I was gonna crop it because it's huge but there's a couple on here that I just personally love like tadris seminar virgo and acotarius
0,so I've seen a lot of people lately doing Target and Shein halls and I just got hired as a marine biologist and my company just sent me what I'll be wearing on the first day and so I thought I'd try it out came in this really great packaging so I'm really excited so here it is um overall its really great quality. I'm really liking the color my fingers don't really fill it out that great um. I'm gonna spin around for you as you can see my a is gone. I think it's up here somewhere in this head area. I have been trying to gain weight and I think that this does give the appearance that I have it's not as curvy as I would like. I don't think I would wear it out. I think it has the whole chasity belt of the sea kind of vibe going um but it has just really cool accessory so overall eight out of ten
-1,"Shine. Count your days. Nobody's gonna slow me. Oh, no, we"
0,"Hello. I'm sorry this is taking me so long, but honestly, like, I have just not wanted to try on these clothes. I don't know why. Like, every day,. I've just been so tired when I get home from work. And anyways, the kids are both asleep right now, my husband's not here, and I'm already wearing some of it, so let's get into it. Okay, first things first is this oversized T-shirt that says on my husband's last nerve. We love that. And then I have these Glow Mode biker shorts, and, like, the hot pink. Love them. They're just pretty short, which, I mean,. I'm fine with them, but I was gonna, like, get them for work, too, but I definitely won't be wearing these to work. But anyways, they're super cute. I love the color, love glow mode, the quality. Amazing. Okay, next we have this oversized tea that has a smiley and says teacher on the back. I've actually already worn this, and I dug it out of the dirty clothes that I could show y'all. But, yeah, super cute. Okay, next is these glow mode shorts, and I'm gonna be honest, I. I don't like them. Honestly,. I got them the last time, and they were too tight, and so I sized up, and I just don't like them. Like, feel like hug my pooch, which is not flattering. And I wore them for, like, a total of 5 minutes the other day, and they Rode up so bad, like, my butt cheeks were hanging out, so I probably won't keep these. And they're glow mode, so. Hmm. I don't know. I just don't like them. Not my cup of tea. All right, here's the first jumpsuit romper free people do thing. I can't really tell. Like, it goes down on the sides. I'm gonna try it with, like, a white T-shirt under, and I'll come back. Okay. Honestly,. I don't hate it. I don't love it either, but I don't hate it. So if you saw my haul, like, the materials very weird. Like, it's not, like cotton like everybody else's free people dupes that I've seen. It's a weird material, but honestly, like, it's not bad. It doesn't do much for me in this area. Pregnant. But I don't know. I might wear it. I don't know. What do y'all think? Okay, I thought this was, like, the same exact one, but it's, like, very big in this area, so it may have just been, like, similar, but not the same exact one. It's still up. Weird material, if y'all can tell. It's just, like,. I don't know what material you would call this, but. Yeah, this one is awkward. And I was thinking. I like this one better because it's black and it would go with everything, but. Hmm. No. Okay. I forgot about these biker shorts, but I love these. I have the same ones in black, so I knew that. I would like, like the sizing of them, but it's like this, like, tie dye ish color, and I really like these. The next one is the long pink free people do, and I'm terrified to try it on. Absolutely not. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't even want to show you all the back. It is so see through, like where this watch shirt stops. You can tell it's so see through. This one is actually like the raw material, like the cotton. All right, I got ready for the back. I'm gonna do it really quick. Really quick. No. All right, next up is these Glen mode white crossover shorts. They have spandex underneath. I really like these. I've already worn them. I actually took them out of the dirty clothes again for you. I really like them. At first I wasn't really sure because, like, these, like, stuck out, like, literally like this when I first worn. But I like pushing down a little bit, and I look better now. Obviously not with a white shirt, but I had another T-shirt that said like, teach them, love them, watch them grow or something that I also got, and I can't find it. It's probably in the dirty clothes cause I already wore it, but I love that one, the oversized one. I'm not gonna show you all cause I don't feel like finding it, but it fit perfectly. Then I have another, like, Mama Cheetah print one that I got. Um,. I don't love it, but I'm gonna try to find that one and show you. I don't know. I can't find the Mama shirt, but if you watch my whole. It's like a black and gray like cheetah print shirt that says Mama. And I like it, but it's not oversized. And I literally got it like, so that I could wear them with these, um, hot pink biker shorts cause I thought it would be so cute. And it's like not oversized at all. But anyways,. I liked most of it, just not. Not the jumpsuits. The pink one is okay, not the black and definitely not the light pink one. Um, and the glow mode shorts. Honestly, like a lot of it was a fail. Still love Shein. Like, I really love it. I've gotten a ton of great stuff that wasn't my first order. I've got a ton of great stuff, but this order was kind of a flop. But yeah, that's my try on haul. The toddler stuff and the toddler stuff I got. Everything was great quality and fits knocks really good. The underwear I got, amazing quality. Love those. The bog bag that I got. Actually used it for the pool today. I love that. I haven't tried my frother yet, but yeah,. I need to. I swear I read the reviews but I guess I don't do a good enough job. Yeah. Anyways, that's all this Has been, like, almost 7 minutes. So if you watched all of this, thank you. But, yeah, y'all have A good day. Bye."
-1,"Y'all look at this. I just opened my box from Shein for a Christmas party. In the shoe literally came like this. Not in this white thing. The shoe literally arrived like this inside of the box. So I'm like, where's the heel? Cause it's supposed to have a heel on it, and the heel is located on the inside of the shoe like that. Why would you even package that to somebody? Good thing the Christmas party isn't for a few more days, because this is a hot mess. Why would you even send this to someone? I have not been on Shin and so long, and this is why. This is the quality. And then what is this great giant hole in plastic? I know it's cheap merchandise, but come on. I was looking forward to rocking those."
-1,"Yeah, why? About a purse from Shane for 1. And this what they send me? They said, Bitch, build it yourself. Build it yourself. Shane deserve every bit of Enrico charges. I even got to put the sticker."

I need to do better when it comes to looking and reading what the measurements are. You know, those foldable, cute little storage, little bins type of things? Well, yeah, I pretty much wanted some of those. And because I didn't look at the measurements,. I got these. These are little baby ones. They're like the size of my. They're smaller than my hands. If you have any idea what I could possibly use these for, please let me know, because I really wanted the bigger ones so that I could put my little hair pins. I mean, not my hair claws, and they're not gonna fit in here. My hair, cause there's no way they're gonna fit in here. So please give me ideas, because I don't know what to put in here."
0,"It's officially been a year since I made this, a video on making a fake Shein skirt for my daughter. I reposted it recently. Now the repost has gone viral. After that, I decided I would make just another video addressing the issues people have. Again, it's just like the people that are really angry that I don't understand. I know that the plot doesn't match up. I don't think it's that big of a deal. Totally 100 capable of matching plaid. I went to fashion school. I know the drill. I didn't have enough fabric, so I placed the pattern the way I could with what I had. And this is how the skirt turned out. She was fine with it. She wears the skirt still. I didn't think that not matching plaid would make people so mad. The other issue people have is like this is building a bad relationship with your daughter because you're lying to her. We immediately told her soon as she opened it, we showed her the video. She thought it was so funny. Another common one is asking how to sew, how to draft patterns. I'm addressing that in. I'm coming up with a YouTube series on how to draft your own skirt. The first one's been recorded and I'm in the works of recording the other videos along with a free downloadable PDF of step by step instructions. Go subscribe to my YouTube channel if you're interested in learning how to draft. Patterns. See ya."
-1,"I think at this point, she and needs to just stop with any wording on their clothing. And it's on the cutest stuff. Like, they did not have to ruin this with fashion and bags. But some of the stuff doesn't even make sense. Like, and I was so pissed cause I thought this bag was so cute. I'm sorry, what? Or it just makes an item, like, scream that it's from Shein. And some of the cuts on these are so cute, and I'm like, oh, my god. But there's no way. I could deal with the conversations of explaining comfort in Paris. And you can tell they're trying to use, like, aesthetic words. Cherish time. We're so deep. Flapping wings, popular style, vintage. Fashion is constantly changing. Okay. And this one, I thought. I was like, man, this is actually kind of cool. I'm a storm, baby. But they don't even have an apostrophe. They have a comma. They have a comma in between the I and m. She did. You're killing me."
-1,"Hahaha! Don't get sweater dresses from Shein. Hahaha. Let me put this on. They won't. Ha ha! Haha. Hang on. Ha ha! Oh, hey. Nothing. Ha ha! That looks way, way better. Oh yeah. No."

So this is a one piece. I need to figure out how to tie it a little better. But pretty cute. Full coverage, hold you in for sure. Um, I really like this one.

Yeah, just like a comfy little. It's got a slit on one side. Um, we got this other one. Yeah, that's one more cover up. I don't know. And then just a little like crappie mesh.

I have been loving these, but today I'm just gonna switch it up, and I'm gonna do the Ilia skin tint. and this is gonna be a little too pale for my skin because I've got Self Tanner on. we're gonna have to bronze the skin. let's bronze the skin up. so I'm using the Fenty Beauty contour stick and mocha. the skin is somewhat bronzed up. we are gonna go. and I hate when I say that. I feel so basic when I say that. we are going to use the torch shape tape concealer. okay, now that the concealer is blended out, let's go in with some rare beauty blush in the shade. bliss. this is a matte blush. I want to try out the glowier ones. okay, now that we have all of our cream products on the face, now I'm just gonna go in with all my powder products and set everything. I'm using the Fenty Beauty translucent powder just to set under my eyes. now, if you're feeling like you just took all of your bronze away,. I like to go in with the physicians formula bronzer set my liquid blush. I love this tarte blush in the shade. captivating.

I got this yesterday in the mail. it's the 68 by that sold Asian arrow. okay, let's go see the baby."
0,"People be like, damn, you're just so chill. I'm like, Thanks. I gave up. Yeah. Done. Towel thrown in the foot."
0,"Let's do a Shein haul. All right, I've not ordered from Shein in a while, so let's just see this bag. As you can see, it's pretty beat up. But let's see what condition everything is in this first piece. Oh, this does not look like Shein to me. Oh, well,. I guess this will be going back. This is the piece I was looking most forward to. It's this beautiful dress with this on the back. But it appears it was damaged. Well, let's take 2. Somehow, I guess that dress fell out of the whole bag. So anyway, next up I ordered this black 2 piece set. A skirt, long maxi skirt. I'll do. If any of this works,. I will do a try on another video. And here is the top. So that might work. Let's see. Here's another little 2 piece set. I was anxious to get in. This is shorts. Kind of cute. And then a little. Oh, a little halter. It goes with the shorts. Next I got in a pair of shoes. I typically have really good luck with she and shoes. I will say they run a little wide on me. Always get like a 9. So what are these? Little clear. Just sandals to throw on for the beach. I got this ring. Pretty. All right,. I got another 2 piece set. This is for our trip to the Bahamas coming up and in October. I thought this would be really Perfect. This blue, kind of like a midi, almost maxi skirt on me. And then has this top. And the last thing in this order is this little white, like a little 2 piece set. This is meant to go over a swimsuit. So I'll try to put this over a swimsuit. It's like this little white top and it came with this really pretty, like, skirt. So, yeah,. I guess we'll see when I do a try on if it's a fail or not."
-1,"So I got this great black turtleneck on Shein so I can wear it all season with all the things. See, it's got. It's got the long sleeves and the turtleneck. It's so cute until I've had it on for four minutes and the entire sleeve just ripped off. So 0 out of 10, recommend."
1,"Today I bring you possibly whatever Shein's advent calendar is. The cutest thing you're going to see on TikTok is from Shein. but this time my mother didn't do it to me. It is 1 calendar that imitates Pandora's bracelets. then on every day there is 1 charm. Thank you in my live shows which, by the way if you want to know when I do direct follow me on another social network because that's where I warn you of everything. You ask me about my Pandora. If you want I can make you 1 separate video to show you because I really like to have 1 charm of every important memory of my life. So let's open this one which costs about 6. I leave here the reference because you will love it. I say this from now on. This calendar is supposed to include 2 bracelets and Charles to complete each bracelet eh. I understand that the bracelet will be available on number 1 and day 24. so let's start with those. I am looking forward to opening this. Let's open day 1 okay it's not the bracelet Ah ok honey it's cute it's like 1 bottle and you see. It has the pocket to put the bracelet. Let's open 24 to see if it is there, i.e. 1 random number. How are you supposed to stick the. I don't understand,. I think that in 24 it does have to be eh Worth one is not Oh. I'm going to show it to you better come and see are Christmas bracelets. Many days. I will try to open for example these 2 columns let's see in which one we get the bracelet why else am I not in is very cute but I am not in to open 06 for example. Ah it's Rudolf 15. Oh,. I'm killing myself. Oh how beautiful. It is the same as Pandora's that there are some that hang. Look,. I'm freaking out 6 I will IR you opening some at random like this to see what this is. Oh it's Santa's sled. How cute. Go. Oops,. I'm screaming a lot the bracelet is supposed to come 2 but well now the question is how do I put it in. Because on 1 side it has wool and on the other hand has as 1 heart Something or something will have to be disengaged. eh. Ah well, my God, this is so cute. You are viewing this 6. It's just that it's superb even by 1 invisible friend because normally invisible friends are between 6 and 15 no more or less which is the same as Pandora's is the same by saving you as a few euros. I got Santa Claus 4 more than this I reach 12. The other bracelet. Look how nice it is the bracelets were on the 17th and 10th. I think that is a bit poorly managed. but apart from that. I think it is very good is beautiful more. But you are watching this. Come this one for example this is one of the best calendars I have ever opened in my life I was looking at Shein's page. to gossip 1 little. I have seen things and I had to see it. I can explain better and it turns out that 2 bracelets are coming because 1 is to make it as in shades of red and another one to do it in shades of green. The only downside I can look for is that. I have just given you 1 idea to give as an invisible albino gift and I can no longer do it because my friends are going to watch this video. I think you are not being aware at this point in the video how beautiful this is. Obviously there are many Charms left we have still opened only half of it. Don't tell me they shouldn't paint something for wear this type of bracelets when you are alone because now how do I tie it? I am 1 crack It looks exactly the same. In other words, someone can see the difference. I don't think so. Ah, here we go with everything and you're talking like 1 rattle. Tomorrow I will upload part 2 opening this calendar is nobody on TikTok. I don't know if it will be new yes he has been in Shein for a long time now I have no idea. What is clear or you contribute or set aside is worth it"
-1,"Hi. So I am a Sheen order. I enjoy Sheen. Um, most of the time, she doesn't fail me, but this is going to be a Sheen fail in my opinion. I'm very interested, though, in your opinion, and if you also think, look at the shadow. I'm on a ring light, but I can't find the cord to plug it in. Anyway, if you also think it's a fail and you, uh, don't like the fit either, or if you do like it,. I'm really interested in your opinion. I think that it's not fitting right. So first, let me show you what I ordered. I was so excited about this, and I was telling, like, my wife and, like,. I'm getting a suit. Like, my first suit is coming. And I've been, like, looking at this on Shein for a while, um, thinking that I wanted to order it, and so I finally, like, bit the bullet, did. And I don't like it. So I expected the pants to be a lot tighter than this. I feel like they're much too loose. The jacket is okay. I don't hate the jacket. Um,. I was planning on showing this to you, and lots of different, like, styles and fits and colors underneath and different ways to wear it, but I think it's going back. I. It's too big here, and it's kind of. I don't know, it's. It's just kind of big everywhere, and I wanted something that was Much more fitted and, um. Like that? Yeah,. I want something a lot more fitted than it is. So I didn't even bother with shoes for you,. Mosquito Bayer. Anyway, so tell me what you think. What are your thoughts on this suit? Would you keep it? She doesn't have pockets. That would be nice, but it's Sheen. I'm kind of used to not getting pockets with Sheen very often. Anyway, tell me what you think. Would you keep it or would you send it back?"
-1,yes I'm gigantic but. I have probably one of the funniest okay I knew it was a long stretch I mean especially look at that price right oh god one of the funniest ones fails total fail really I mean I get that it stretches but and this is what they gave me. I don't think this I don't think this would fit my arm no joke so this is what I ordered hahaha however people pronounce it this brand
0,"the lighting is horrible, but I got a bunch of bathing suits from Shein because I'm on a one piece bathing suit kit right now. so let me know which one you think. I'm so scared. looks the best. this is the most awkwardly shaped bathing suit. I think I've ever put on. like, whose boobs is this supposed to fit right? idea clearly not for me. again, can we make bathing suits for people with not fake poops? I just, like, squish everything. it looks good from the side, but if you'll notice, my boobs are smushed down into my belly button. whose torso is supposed to be this short? like, it's not even 1ft. it's okay. where do you guys get your bathing suits for tall girls that are a little thick in the middle?"
-1,"This these are what they ordered why do brands do this whereby you order from them and they see your packages? I just feel like I'm going to tell you but this time they told me but I wasn't aware I wasn't. I was only aware one package that was split into like 2 but this one was split and I was expecting quite a large box of items anyways, let's unbox this one and see what's inside. Um, I ordered these or rather this off Shein and okay is all the other this is what I ordered and it says there solid ribbed neat sweater vest without blouse it specifically said without the blouse. So what is the blouse not white thing that ladies wearing. Am I wrong or something? So she oh my God it's not even the right blouse like it's not even the blouse that was displayed here. It's not this blouse here. Hmm and this they the same shit. I'm sorry where the details come on she know my first time order for you guys. Why are you doing this to me? More than disappointed more than disappointed but I'll wait for the other orders to arrive and see what happens."

-1,"Right. This is my hair topper that I got off hair called off the TikTok shop. Right. It needs washing, so I'm gonna wash it. But that is the length, and it matches my roots because that's what my hair goes like. So it's got three clips. Don't look at that one. I had no cotton, so I use green. But that's the part. 3 clips. This is the better of the two that I got off Shein. So doesn't look that different. And I thought that wasn't gonna look that bad compared to that, but it's just not the quality. It says it's human, but I don't know, it just looks shit on my head. And this one, I don't know what the fuck this is. Look at that. And you might say that doesn't look bad. And it is supposed to be human hair. And you can style them. I've tried. I look like Rod Stewart. Buy cheap, pay twice. Trust me. Now, that's got potential. That needs washing. I'm gonna wash it now. But that is amazing. And I can curl it, can straighten it, can do whatever. And I probably can with these. But this one. What the hell is that? Those two cost me 35 quid from Shein. That one I got as a free sample of hair code. But the prices vary. They can be hundreds of pounds or they can be half priced, depending on when you buy them. So you get what You pay for. Unfortunately"

It is from Shein. Should have known. But my partner today was walking behind me and pointed out that we've got some serious inconsistencies on this. Atlas shirt. So let me walk you through some of the best one. Okay, so here's the back of it. United States capital,. Washington. Like, seems normal. Ish. We're getting some mist color here, but then, like, what happened to South America? I'm sorry. It's hard to get the fold. Apparently. Now it's right next to Norway. I don't think Myanmar is in South America. There is a sort of he day. There's no, not Chile exactly, but he. They. I like how there are different fonts. We got time to new Roman and whatever this is. That's, like, kind of. Kind of right. I don't know what this letter M is for. Randomly just M. Um. Europe is, like, more or less the right shape. However, the choices of font are just completely random. I like Puyand. You're in the middle. New Zealand is here, but, like, completely alone. There's no. No sign of Australia anywhere on this shirt. This little green patch is definitely supposed to be China, but it's just the Republic of Jill. And then if we go up to Africa, which apparently gets surprisingly skinny. In the middle. And seems to have just left out a whole lot of countries. It's kind of hard. It's, like, not fully pictured, but, yeah, that's"

-1,"All right, y'all,. I've got to pick a bone with. With a lot of people here. I always see lots and lots of people getting Shein hauls, and I'm sitting here in the back of my van packaging up. I have this one, and then I have an entire box of Shein stuff because I needed summer clothes and I need new business clothes. And so one night, I stayed on way too late, did some late night shopping. Should not have done that. And bought a ton of things from Shein. It was relatively inexpensive, and I thought, this is awesome, but, like, it's not. It's not awesome. Let me see where. If I can find. Okay, I think this is it. Like, the quality was. Was not good. A lot of the materials were all the same. Like, everything was the same material. No matter what kind of shirt, it just felt the same. This. I mean, I cannot figure out what this was for the life of me. I just sat there like, what the heck? It's supposed to be a halter top, but it just looks like. It just looks like my son, who loves to do projects. Cut fabric and made it crisscrossy, and you can tie it around your body. I do photography, and sometimes I literally use sheets and stuff to make, like, dresses for maternity people. That's kind of how that was. So not a fan. I don't know. What did I. Do wrong. I would so much rather go to a thrift store, to be quite honest. It's cheap and the, you know, sometimes the clothes are not even worn. And the quality is gonna be so much better. So I don't know. Tell me what I did wrong. Cause everyone else has these amazing halls. They're so happy. It's not it for me."
-1,"So I feel like I can finally come clean and talk about this because enough time has passed, and I feel comfortable telling my truth. Um, back in December of 2022,. I was victimized by Xian. Let's. Let's get into it. Okay. So I ordered this dress for a work conference that I was going to in New York City in December. I thought, okay, it's gonna be warm, it's gonna be cute, it's, you know,. Christmassy. I'm get some tights, and I even got the belt to go with it. I thought it was gonna be so perfect. Okay, I'm. Here's what happened. What the fuck is that? First of all. First of all, um. I look like fucking Humpty Dumpty. Okay? And it. Why is it see through? It was not see through on the photo. And what is that skinny ass bottom of. What is that skinny ass bottom of the dress? Okay, I'm not a skinny girl by any means, but. Ooh, but it gets better. Hold on. That is giving Humpty Dumpty. That is Humpty. Humpty dumpty's hot ass sister right there. Also, where is my neck? Where's my neck? Don't know her. Don't have one. Hmm. Count your days. Count your mother fucking day. She in.

0,literally filmed part one to this. TikTok Deleted it. I had to film it again and then I filmed part 2. TikTok Deleted it and I'm filming it again so hopefully this works now. I'm pissed off cause it literally already opened everything but these are my outfit options for young gravy so let's see first and foremost I got a black corset and I mean you're gonna very quickly figure out what kind of vibe I'm going for but I got that then I got this one which I'm pretty obsessed with already and I did not realise is apparently a piece of lingerie because it came with a matching thumb kind of like that then I am not wearing this one which is really really really really really cute and I like it so we'll see about that one and then I got this and this is the first time I've ever gotten something from Shein that is not what I ordered because I literally was like. I wish you could have seen my initial reaction. I was like what the fuck is this but it's like that right like it's cute but not for what I'm going for um and then it's got these right I got hearts all over them yeah that's not what I ordered this was black and these were attached and did not have hearts on them and it did not look like this so that's that's not happening at all in any way shape or form so that there's that. I just wanted to like pause it really quick and make sure that it didn't delete all of that cause I would have been so pissed off anyways so yeah I don't know maybe I'll try them on really quick cause I just said all that really fast since I wasn't opening them I don't know we'll see. I'm dead I'm dead imagine this with jeans and proper boobs so she's giving and it's not even like properly tied right now. I really like it but he needs proper boobs because this makes a bitch flatter than flat so let's try the other one and see I really want to love this one maybe it's just like the sweatpants because like it is but like no no. I feel like. I don't know I don't like it like I do like it and I will wear it but it's not giving young gravy not what I thought it was so like the right outfit on the right day this would be cute but for now no

-1,"What I ordered from Shein versus what I got. Okay,. I'm not. Oh, I wanted it because that slit back is really cute. I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do with this. Hopefully this phone doesn't fall. Um, I mean, I figured out,. I think, that it's to tie, right? You can, like, tie it, but then it has this. So I'm like, okay, do I just, like, extra tight? Like, do I make it extra hoochie for me? Oh. I mean, sorry, but it's not what I wanted. I wanted that slip back. Returning"
1,"I went on Shein to buy one thing and ended up buying 50 things. Let's do a haul. I have no one this year buy me Christmas gifts, so I bought my own. It's justifiable, as always. These were what I wanted to buy, and I don't know how this happened. I wanted to find some cute little Ugg dupes, but I can't even lie, y'all. This looks like horses feet. Tis the season. My god. My bestie is rich. Can't relate. We got herself the Ugg bag, and I was jealous, so I got myself something kind of. No, it doesn't even look similar. Can you think that? This bag is so cute. And it has this tiny little coin purse that you could fit tiny things like your man just. I love Sherpa things. So cute. I also got this glass cup as a gift. It's a body glass of a thick woman. Obviously. I would not buy that for me. What the heck is this? Yeah, I did not order this bag. Anyone wants this, let me know. I'm too lazy to return things, but I did order this bag. It's like a puffer purse. I have this in black, and I get so many compliments, so I had to get in, like, the nude. The last purse I got. Was it gingy? I'm fighting for my life to be my mom's favorite kid, so I got her this because she's obsessed with gingerbreads. I think I'm Gonna win. I think I'm gonna no again. Favorite daughter of the year. I got my mom a gingerbread. What's it's called? I've been um, wearing shirts like this recently cause my nails are terrifying. I got myself some press on nails cause I haven't had time to go get the Nike done. These were only a dollar! I love that you're able wear them for a week and then like when you're bored you just pop them off. I also picked up 15 powder puffs because I need 15. Obviously. I did get a ton of jewelry. I'll show you guys the ones that aren't gifts. Oh no! Those Cartier bracelets that um. People who are rich half. I got the two dollar stainless steel Shein knock off. You know what? I'm actually kind of impressed. I also got myself a bow ring. It says that it's not going to like, stain my finger green. So then I got myself a bow necklace to match. Also got a lot of bows because nothing about me is original. I got this bow headband because I'm the gift this year. Also got pink hair clip bows and then a huge clip. Oh it doesn't stop there. Some bow socks, a red bow for the back of my hair, some more bow socks, and a bow dress since I've been obsessed with red lately. I got this huge knit red sweater. And then I got one in pink because. I don't have A reason there's still so much in this box. The last things I'll show you guys, though, is these scarves. I've been loving layering my clothing, and it's freezing, so why not? I also got this red one, which I think I'll give to my Nona. This shirt was only 3, y'all, and it's like one of those good material. I cannot wait to wear this to the gym. I hardly leave the house. What am I saying? Now that was, uh, my unnecessary Christmas haul to myself."
0,"I hate being short because I feel like this should look good, you know, and it's shorts, but I'm like, it looks like a dress. I feel like if I was a little taller, me up like this, and then that would be, like, a little better. I don't know. How do you think that this looks?"
-1,"Jean, we need to have a little talk. so, I don't typically online shop. um, I've, like, more recently got into it, but I was like, oh, I'm gonna order some stuff from Shein.

0,"I have always been skeptical about Shein, but a lot of, like, when I compliment people, they always tell me, Oh,. I got it at Shein. So I was, like, looking on there, okay? And I found this shirt, and I loved it. And I was surprised they had it, like, you know, in a big size like me and what do you call it? So I was like, okay, let me order it. I looked at the reviews. They all said, order up, whatever. I got the biggest size there was. Ciao, girl. No, like, that was the biggest size they had, which was bigger than my size. Like, I'm a 2 x, and they had, like, a 4 x"
-1,"okay, here's part 2 of me trying shit on from Shein. so here's another dress. I don't realize how many dresses I ordered. um, I don't know. I don't like it. I feel like it makes me look fat. like, stripes are always, like, it, but then, like, I feel, like, the sleeves, and then, like,. I don't like how, like, tight this is up. I wish it was more, like, around the waist. so I think this is going back. okay, so here's another dress. this might be the last one. I don't really know, but I thought this one was, like, really cute. online for, like, New Years or, like, the holidays, but the holidays and years are over, so I don't know. it's like, this one's actually really, really thick and has, like, really great quality, considering it's from Shein. so I'm, like, impressed with that, but I don't know how I feel about this otherwise. okay, I found another set, but I don't like this one. it's, like, cute in theory, but I think it's just, like, it's too small. like, you can see all of her, and I don't like it. okay, so I just threw the shirt back on because I needed to wear something, and the new item are these pants. again,. I don't love them. like, the line is, like, perfectly, like, oh, here's my fat. so I'm, like, really thin. there's no pockets. I think you're going back. okay. I'm very uncomfortable, because this is a swimsuit, but this is, like, one, and I got. I don't know. it's okay. I don't like how, like, outside keeps, like, popping out. it's all right. okay, so there's this other swimsuit, but I hate it. I look disgusting. and I can't even get the straps over my shoulders, so. no. okay, this one, like, I like better from the front. it's like a connected. but, like, the back, I feel like, looks like those swimsuits you have as a kid when you're, like, learning to swim. and these straps, I thought were adjustable. they're not. it's literally just for show. so I think this was gonna go back. it's a little too tight. okay, so the last thing is, like, this cover up denim sort of shirt. um, I'm not wearing anything underneath it, so I'm not gonna, like, flash you, but I think this is really cute. I like big cover ups like this, so I think I'm definitely gonna keep this one. all right, so that was all my items? um, yeah. kind of a big fail. not a lot of great things, but, like, it's. she. and, like, I didn't really have high hopes, but I really do like the stuff that I'm gonna keep, so that's always good. okay, bye."

-1,"So something I really like is Shein fails because they have a lot. They try to sell really badly translated t shirts. The editing, it's garbage, among other things. But let's commence starting off strong. We have this, um. Her arm is just completely curved to her. But not. Not. Not the best, not the worst I've seen, but not very good. Then we have this T-shirt. One monkey banana cob. Feel different. Don't know what that means. I'm scared. So this one is more the description than it is the picture, but it says one piece random Crystal ghost is not just for Halloween decor. For doing meditation to get spirit.

It know it's bad. I'm sure there's plenty of, you know, actual black people. Not when we found a model, but another graphic team. Walk into my wonderland. Rose like lady. Always stunning. Walk into my wonderland. I don't even. I don't even know. I can't show this one, but it's bad. We have another classic couch and curtain situation going on. You're not ready for this one. Yeah. Got some more words. Give you my best wishes. Don't worry. Be happy. Time for happiness. 1998, memory of Bears. I just thought this one is interesting.

-1,"I don't usually buy things on Shein, but I did it anyway cause I was gonna pay 1,000 for majority clothes. I don't know why I was slicing through this. Uh, that was kinda dumb cause these aren't clothes. You know, granted,. I wasn't expecting much, but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. So first I opened up some underwear and you guys, this is so funny. Like I was looking at the lining and there's literally glue and like a felt piece is so bad. Like, what is that? Those are definitely not gonna go in my body. I got these little shapewear things and let me tell you, I don't. It shaped nothing. I mean, I wasn't blessed in the area, but these did nothing for me. Then these look kind of promising. The stitching was actually really good and it wasn't see through, but it doesn't look good on this dress. When I touched it, immediate disappointment. Then I was super excited about this two piece and I touched it too and it's horrible. And it came like tied up like this. What the heck was that? So I untied it,. I tried this on and I literally looked like a dust bunny. It was horrible. And lastly, to go out with a bang. This smelled like straight period blood. We're not talking about that. Bye."

Okay, here are the shoes. Um, they are flat, they are bedazzled. Um, they looked cuter, they looked cuter online. Um, looking at them now, they look like old lady shoes. Let me show you what they look like on. I so this is what they look like on, um, the little strap in the back. My cat is gonna knock over, let's try that again. The little strap in the back would not stay on, and even if they were cute, so that's a no, going to be a return. So there are a lot of comments of other places for me to try looking for dresses. Um, I'm still gonna be looking for a white dress, even though there were lots of comments of people saying I shouldn't wear white. I live in Oklahoma, and it's the winter, so I will be tanner, um, come spring when I have to wear these white dresses.

0,"Let's see girls, several days ago on social networks girls have been making viral some videos with shein's garments in which it is said that they ask for help on the labels of these garments. And people who know me will know that I just did a venture in which I am starting to sell bikinis and shein clothes and obviously I am curious. So let's look in the garments to see if this is true, okay, the first thing I'm going to do is open. This garment is totally new, I have not used it at all, okay, this garment says absolutely nothing, but let's look or. and well, in this outfit does not say anything. We go to check a bathing suit, open it, take it out immediately and look for nothing. Also in this one we are going to check these blouses girls, to see if in these blouses there is nothing girls, but we still need to check several garments follow me for part 2."

It was like white this color and black and I was like oh I love like plain cute shirts. And before you come after me for more for ordering from Shein but I found like these shirts or whatever every time It's literally like a bra. I swear to God if you're a hair stylist and say like oh I would wear that. I actually do work for a salon with a dress code. It did not look like this in the photo shirts off of Shein is all I'm saying. I just wanted to get something cheap because I'm a stylist and they would not appreciate it if I showed up in this. Like I'm not gonna spend a lot of money on stuff for work and I get color on my shirts all the time. Okay I don't know if this happens to anybody else
-1,"Hey, guys. I just ordered a large Shein, and we're gonna test it. That's actually not bad. Hated that. The fabric was awful. This was really confusing. I think it could be cute, though. I don't really know. Uh, this was not bad. Kind of weird tie. This literally was trash. That was okay. This was okay. But the fabric was a little bit weird, but I still like it. Those were atrocious. I thought that it was gonna be, like, jeans, and same for these, but, like, those fabrics were awful. That literally looks like ski pants. And it felt like ski pants. These, looking back, are terrible. We'll see, though. That I don't know how to sing. You look like a purple Smurf. Don't like this. I'm actually wearing right now. It's decent. I like it. Um, those boots were supposed to be purple. This actually is kind of fun. I don't really know. There's a lot you can do with it. Um, so, anyway, bye."

I used them. they melted into my hands. literally disappeared into my hands. never seen anything like it. I couldn't wash it off. it would it just disappeared into my skin immediately. my hands went numb. I'm sitting here thinking it's 11 pm at night. maybe this will get better. I'm washing my hands a lot. woke up in the morning and I couldn't feel anything all the way up to my elbow. had to go to urgent care. said it was chemical poisoning. describe me some stuff, including steroids. and it got better. here I am 3 weeks later and it's starting to go a little bit numb again. do they've been off for a while. I noticed when they started to go numb again. my fingers started to peel. I don't know if you could see that. but now they're peeling. they weren't doing that 2 days ago. this is 3 weeks later. got a lot of dms on my Instagram because people can't DM you here on TikTok if you don't follow them. people saying they were also poisoned from the same exact product. and they were poisoned from their clothing, where they had, like, reactions and had to go to urgent care, too. turned off the comments on my last video because y'all are doing too much. y'all trying to put blame on people and be sick and, like, nasty, nasty people. I'm trying to get this message out there because people are literally getting poisoned from products from shein. even if you get your nails done at a salon. you're at risk too. this video is just to help people to raise awareness, to spread the information because you don't wanna go to urgent care at the emergency room because you're losing feeling in your arms. I don't know what she in is doing, but somebody needs to hold them accountable."

I like this one a lot this one's really cute it took my a second to figure out the straps she's twirlable. I don't like it again. I think I should have gotten a large because there's no stretch right here she's a little staticky. I want to keep her you need some static art. And if Ive been feeling super bloated that day there's no flowy to it like I could sleep in this thing it hits me right here one piece swim suit that I will not turn around in because it is like floss. Tuck into the bra again. I don't like where those hits it's like this good oversize. I guess it'll work. I think she's hilarious she's not appropriate for this world it's a pain and 12 we ended on a good note. I'm not even gonna show you this one isn't this hilarious it's so funny. I mean I guess I could tuck it into the sports bra. I'm too big in the hips. I'm holding onto the strings because I had to like hand tied the the back. I got myself 5 dresses it hits me right here. I don't have the boobs to fill it out 3 pump covers 2 swimsuits and 4 shirts for my husband we got one more stay tuned for another video for my husband's shirts got pump covers and tell me this isn't a fun shirt because I took too long for this one but she's cute she is a thong she is a thong high cut it's a t Rex flicking off the asteroid it's untucked tucks oversized shirt in underneath her bra to like for leg day very blue and you can really accentuate that waist I think. I feel like a child just went and finger painted the fuck out of this dress it's time for another Shein haul. I got a lot in here like not only for myself but for my husband
1,okay so I brought these wristband things that are pain in the ass to get on because they're so small from Shein earlier and I thought let's see if we see if these work basically. I have already started washing my face. I currently have this on there is the Melting Gel Cleanser for dry skin by No. 7. I absolutely love this stuff it totally rate it so yeah it's already on there and I usually just use water to remove it so I'm gonna get some water in my hand and just see if these actually work and do their job and stop it from dripping down my arms it actually feels like it actually is working that so actually is stopping it let's try a bit more water okay that is actually working the arms are not wet yeah they definitely work. I mean they're really really hard to get on but all of my skin is dry. I mean this is how difficult they are to get on and off. Was trying to save a bit of money because the beauty work ones are quite expensive but they're actually so difficult to get on and off but if you have smaller hands and smaller wrists. I think these are great and I think they cost me like 2 or something like that so yeah these definitely work but they are tiny
0,"master. the female orgasm. now what? incredible. it's a quick party. I'll have you back later. okay, I'll do it. but as soon as Jess says, I've got to go home. thank you very much for your mitigated support in the tiny portion of your life."

0,POV you ordered your grad shoes from Shein
0,"This is the real contrast of sheen. A week ago, the ultra fashion sheen launched its first popup store in the city of monterrey, where many people visited, as well as long lines to enter the store. to this popup store from 08: 30 in the morning. Clearly this popup store was a success for the brand, as well as they said they are missing 2 other popup stores in 2 other cities in mexico. And while all this is going on, messages of help from sheen's employees also went viral again. A tiktok user relates how to find a message that said,. I need your help on the label of her shein swimsuit. But this is not the first time this has happened. Messages such as I have dental pain, help me, help, I need your help, among others, have already been found previously, which increases the conversation about labor exploitation and forced labor. that shein employees receive, once again reinforcing the message that buying fashion has major consequences."

0,so I got this jacket on shein and I really love it it's super cute but when they said oversized they meant oversized and I literally could wear this dress. I thought about just wearing it as dress like to work but I think I'll get a lot more use out of it if it's actually a jacket so I'm gonna attempt to cut it we'll see what happens okay so I have this little like tool that I use with my cricut when I'm heat pressing and I just like use this to line it up on the side and I think I'm gonna go above the second button. I feel like that's still kind of long but I can always cut shorter if I need to. I just drew a straight pencil line across and I'm literally cutting it with kitchen scissors that's all I have. I actually have one of those like fabric like roller cutters but it's at my parents house so we're just gonna make 2 okay moment of truth let's see oh okay that's actually I thought that's not that bad. I feel like I would wear this maybe I should just like fringe up the bottom a little so it looks just like a raw hem that's supposed to be raw and not like. I just cut it with kitchen scissors tell me what you think
0,"So I ordered a bit of a haul from Shein a couple of weeks ago. Um, anyway, in that haul,. I decided to order a new shower curtain pull. Um, cause. I'm gonna be doing the bathroom up in a couple of weeks. Um. Ice. It came today. Let me show you. What's wrong? So this is the shower curtain pull. It said on the website that it goes from. Extends from 120 cm to 180 cm. This is it extended. Um, I think someone needs to sort out the metrics or the website, but, um. Yeah. Anyone got any idea what I can use this for? Thanks."
0,What you think you're getting off Shein versus what you actually get
1,"With Valentine's Day right around the corner,. I ordered some things to wear to work, but, man, did I mess up. I got this cute shirt from Timo. It's adorable. And then I've got these cute earrings to match from. Shein, but I'm in my headband error. So I got this cute headband, but let's look closer at it, shall we? So I got this from Shein, not really paying attention to exactly what it says. So. So that's fun. I don't think I can wear that to work. Or maybe I can still wear it and nobody will ever notice."
-1,"our intend demos porque la socias no Symbians. s p s s. chinas. they're so ugly. oh, my God. okay, this is what I wanted. okay, this is the pastels, and this is what I got."
-1,"Okay, sometimes you buy something that you have no idea why you bought. See, it's not about I'm confused why did I buy it? But it's more like,. WTF did I buy one of the cheapest,. I'm not just saying in terms of price, but in terms of quality. One of the cheapest product that I have found in Shein. It's actually just 3 pair of glasses, sunglasses, and I got them for like of the night or so. I don't know. What was I thinking? I mean, with that price reach,. I should have expected it to be trash. It's like pure plastic. I don't even know how to explain it. Okay, this, I think I'm kind of feeling this one. It has the vibe. Yeah, I think this is kind of good. I mean, it's better than the other ones, but it's not exactly good, you know, never mind."
1,unpack my shein order with me and i'm sorry about my window in the background i just this is the only place i can really set my phone up and talk or anything is right here in my bed yes i'm still in my bed i'm still recovering from surgery so what do you do when you can't do anything you shop right these are really really cute and i hope there is advertised because you just never know in fast fashion i am dying for these little crop tanks they are super super fuzzy i got a four pack so i got black brown white and this really pretty green color here is the green color it's really dark green and these aren't sheer so i'm not going to be busting out of them i would do a try on haul but that's a little hard to do when you have a leg in a brace next time i will do a try on haul now these ones are kind of the same idea wait did i order these twice oh great i ordered these twice that's what you get for being on medication and shopping i guess my daughter is getting some cute little bralets too this is the other four pack of shirts that i thought that other package was and these tanks came in white this brown color black and that green color that's kind of the same as the other one but these are so cute this is like a forest green i don't know if it's really coming out on my camera cause i don't have a ring light set up or anything um and they're kind of sheer so i will probably wear like a bralette underneath these or double them up this really pretty brown one i really like this one so i needed some really cute like bra let tank top type things um and i ordered some pants that will go over my big leg brace for the next few weeks so hopefully they'll show up soon so tell me have you ever had a shein fail let me know in the comments haha

0,"Guys, I've been duped. What I thought this was gonna be was, like, this nice sequin to match mine. Mine I got from torrid, but a long time ago. But, you know,. I thought it'd be real sequins. I didn't read the description at all, just based off the picture. I usually go based off the picture because I'm an impulse fire, and I just. If it seems good and it's in their sizes,. I get it. So, um, that's partially my fault. But, look, it's fake sequence. And not only did I get one for my oldest daughter,. I also got one for the youngest daughter. So now we still match, but not really, because it's fake. And everyone. I'm not the only one. Everyone. I should have read the views. Everyone in the comments. Some people said they liked it. Some people knew that they messed up, too. Oh, it's so bad. But it does."
0,"so I got a wild hair and decided I would clean out my drawer because I'm like, like my dresser drawer because I'm a borderline hoarder. I said it. I said it. and I ran across this beauty. I ordered it off of, um, shame a while back. I gotta show you what it says. hold on. wishy bent and held down what is wishy. I think they had too much wishy when they done this shirt. I'm literally dying. I don't know whether to put this in the donate bin or keep it because this is golden right here like that little baby."
0,It's for your mouth. Let me know if you need a bigger piece.
-1,"So when you order from Shein, and this is what happens. I ordered me little girl, she's begged me for ripped jeans. This is what's come. Leggings with pretend rips on them. She's gonna be like, I am not wearing them. What are they? Look at them. Leggings with pretend rips on and pretend pockets and everything. She's gonna be like, no chance. Sorry. That's a fail."

1,"Hey, guys. Okay, so I, like, the biggest Shein hot ever. I'm probably gonna have to do a couple parts because I have, like, a lot of stuff, and I literally unbox all the stuff. And then I literally, like, the post, like, disappeared when I posted it, so I have to redo it, but it's okay. Okay, so I'm gonna start off with, like, the little stuff. First. I got this really cute, hot pink, uh,. Airpod case for my AirPods, and I'm so excited to put it on. Then I got this leopard kit phone case for my phone. Leopard print. Then I got these really cute bracelets. Okay, so this is the bracelets, and they're literally so cute, especially for summer. Then I got this 8 pack of earrings. They're a little bigger than I expected, but I think they're still cute. Then I got this really adorable flower necklace. And then I got this necklace that has an A on it. And then I also got this chain necklace to, like, layer it with. Okay, so I think this is the last and, like, the, like, small stuff, but I got these power pops, and I'm literally so excited to use them. Like, I've seen them all over TikTok, and if they blend good, they're probably gonna be really good, and they're so cute. Okay, I'm gonna start off with, like, the bathing suits first. Oh, I forgot. I have these pink little hoop earrings. Okay, So I got this really cute orange top, and it just ties in the back. Huge, huge. And then these are the bottoms. It also came with, like, this scarf thing, but I'm probably not gonna wear it. Then I got this green bathing suit set. These are the bottoms, and then this is the top. I also have the same bathing suit and hot pink, and I got them because they fit me really well. Then I got the same thing in purple. Then I got this really cute pink flowery top, and then it just has, like, a little tie in the middle. I got these really cute white bottoms. I saw them at target, but they were like 20 bucks, so I wanted to get them on Shein and they're so cute. Then I got this red bathing suit top, and I meant to get it in pink, but I think I accidentally got red. But it's still cute and I can wear it for the 4th of July, so I'm so excited. I'm gonna have to make a separate part for the clothes, and then I'm probably gonna do a try on, too."
0,"So I bought this on Shein. It's cute. It got a little skirt or whatever. But now everywhere I turn, I see everybody with it. And now I can't wear it. Can't wear it."
-1,"So this is what I thought that I ordered on Shein. Um, yeah, this is what I thought I ordered. This is what I got. It looks so crap. And if you look closely, they've just taped it all together. I mean, it was, like, under pounds. Oh, but come on. Am I supposed to do that junk? Are you for real?"
0,"Thought I was gonna be cute in my shine coat, but I'm out here looking like Missy Elliot in the rain video. Beep, beep. Who got"
-1,"Shan, you can count your dates, because the way y'all tried me is not acceptable. Okay? Oh, my office is having a theme day next Monday, so I decided to order outfits because it's a Valentine's Day theme, right? So let me show you the outfit. Okay, so this is the outfit that I ordered. I got this headband, the earrings to match these tights, the shoes, and this blazer dress. Okay? And to be clear, these are the tights. This is what they look like. It says women's, right? Let me show y'all what the hell they sent me. Let me show you. Keep in mind, I'm 5 9. I understand that, okay? But look at these tights. What is this? Those are my kneecaps. This is the crotch area. Why are. What the fuck is that shit? Why? Just. Why?"
0,"Sorry Shein, is this a joke right now? Okay, I ordered this bathing suit off of Shein, okay? As it was delivered today. Okay, can you see? So, I get a package today from Shein, like oh sweet, it's my fudging bathing suit. Look at the bag, it's pretty heavy, little too heavy for a bathing suit. I'm a little suspicious. Why did I get a colorful set of silverware? Four little spoons, four big spoons, four forks, and four knives. I'm very confused. Where's my bathing suit? I didn't even know Shein sold silverware. What the fudge is going on? Like, has this happened to anyone else before? Ordering from them? I'm so confused right now."
0,You think we'll get our money back? I hope so.
0,"So, the rest of my Shein stuff came in. Let's take a look-see. What is this? This is not my Shein haul. I did not order this. What even is this? I don't think I ordered this. This is wrong. Okay, this I definitely ordered. Are you really from Jersey if you don't own everything Cheeto?"
1,"Shein haul. So I got some stuff in here for me and my daughter. It. Oh, mostly for. So for her for summer. A little spray bottle for her hair. Make it easier to wet it down. Some water on it. Go on,. Rico. Are you kidding? I just got a pink one and a black one, and I got this. I've been seeing them on TikTok. And see how to put in the bathroom, in the shower. And then I also got. Well, that's little. That's not promising. I guess we'll see. It's a toothbrush and toothpaste holder. Easier get off the counter. Out of my way so I can keep looking at it. Hey. Hey. These are for me. I got 3 of these. Like, a green, blue, white, and red. I got. This is one of those little nail stamper things so you could do, like, the friendships or whatever. I've been wanting them for forever. This is what I'm super excited about. One of the reasons. It's a little swim cover. And here's the little suit. Okay. Adorable. I'm hoping that it fits her right, because sometimes in the chest, it'll, like, bow forward, which obviously, she doesn't. Did I do anything? But I just want her to know that that should be covered. Hey, let me do this, please. Okay, I got. This is also. Oh, my goodness. Forgot how cute this is. Okay, look, so it is a 2 piece. And actually got 2 Oh, my god. A purple one and a brown. Lavender and brown. This is my swimsuit. Yeah, I got swimsuit. I got the highway student. I don't know. That's really highway. So I don't know how I feel about that. And then this. Really beyond good. And then this little top to go with it. I also got this pack of, like, hair stuff. Makes it easier to do her hair. She's been doing really good at sitting still and let me do it, so I want you to be cool. And then what is this? Oh, my cappuccino maker. It's a little frother for my. My creamer for my coffee. I love that shit. Now, this is the shorts and a T-shirt outfit. Beyonce little. Sure. And then just some black little biker shorts. I think that's horrible. So cute. It's also just a pair of shorts and T-shirt. Is Los Angeles. I thought that's adorable. This is, like, the first thing I don't think I recognize. Actually bought. That's cute. That's really cute, but I don't think I bought this. And then, oh, yeah, this is a little romper for me. Um, I don't know, a little box ish. I guess it tightens on the sides. I might try this stuff on and show you or try it on, BB. We'll see. Okay. It's cute. The square that I thought for sure. Okay, so clearly a different undergarment, but it's cute. Comfy. Yeah. Like it? I think it's nice. We're just gonna clap for every letter. Also, those little rubber things that have no buttons or anything. You just pull them over. So super, super fun. Cute. You like it? Take it out. Take. More occupied with this Rachel or anything, but all these clothes on. What does an owl say? So pretty. Let's see if I can get this thing figured. Let's stick it to the wall. I'm assuming that my toothpaste is inside this. I don't know if I understand this part, but we'll see. This is pretty cool, actually. Okay, so you just grab your toothpaste and then watch. Watch. So I am gonna flip them on first and then take the sticky stuff off of these and hang it on there. Okay, so change of plans. I have to reclaim a different area because it doesn't fit. It doesn't fit into my little round spot right there. So I have to put it in an actual corner on the top of the wall up here. So got to reclaim. I don't know. Whatever. That's pretty cool. Update. Uh, it fell out the bathroom, so it's gonna be a little spice rack now. We'll see how that goes. Actually, pretty, pretty convenient, if I do say so myself. You're right. Are you stuck?"
0,"So let's go shopping at Target. My Shein order was delayed. So the rest of my Shein stuff came in. This is my current outfit. I found this bodysuit and freaking loved it. But the skirt not so much. Had a cute slit and I thought it would work great, but it did not. Tried the skirt again, hated it. I think I'm just too short in my belly. This literally made me like a snowman. I was obsessed with this dress. And put it on and again, it's just too long. If it were shorter. It's not cute. Next, the bodysuit with my pants. 10 out of 10."
0,"So on Shein, there's quite a few things that are pretty ugly and disgusting, but I kind of like certain things. Now this had a different fabric with this fabric I love it. This is a blatant ripoff of Prince. Why would you even bother? That shirt already exists, but it's Shein now if you want LuLaRoe without LuLaRoe. This is... You cannot tell me that that's not LuLaRoe; that looks so much like it. And just in time for Pride month, you can be the whole flag. Now um, that's a no for me. Now I can never stand these types of things. This right here aggravates me. It's definitely like early 2000s; I hate it. Do you like to look like a piece of ham and a curtain?"
0,"Okay, so I got some clothing for work from Shein. Um, so I'm just gonna unbox that with you too. The order came into shipment, so I've already worn this once. Um, I wear this professionally. It's a two-piece set. And then I bought this skirt; haven't tried it on yet, um. So, it's like a Kim K sort of look. Okay, it was inside out. I like professional besides those damn stilettos. It's too late though, but there are many different things I can do with it. I don't have the energy to return them, but yeah. Okay, that's everything for me for my haul."
-1,"Okay, so Amazon fail for me, this skirt. I wanted to love it. I'm gonna try to find something similar to it. Problems with it: the seaming is incredibly bad on the side, and the top seaming, you can see the elastic. So, if you wanted to pair this with something like a bodysuit, it would not work, but the color is beautiful. I love the silk look, so I'm gonna try to find something similar. But for this one, it is a no-go."
0,"""This is what happens when you order your clothes from Shein, and I'm not talking about what goes on in the factory. I'm talking about what happens when your clothes leave the factory on their way over. So they'll be sent on a boat that looks something like this. These cargo ships are constantly traveling from different countries, different ports, all around different oceans at all times. Everything that you have in your house, everything in your closet, anything you order online, most likely has come from one of these trade routes. But why is this a problem? The trade routes aren't the problem, but the shipping containers are. As you can see here, these shipping containers are about to fall into the ocean. This is a very, very common phenomenon. It is estimated that around 1,300 shipping containers are lost in the ocean every single year. And what do they do about this? Do they pick it up? Do they come back for it? No, they just let it sink, and its components are left to sit in the ocean. And inside each of these shipping containers is a variety of different items that shouldn't be in the ocean. For example, in 1992, a cargo ship lost around 28,000 rubber ducks in the ocean. Now this is happening every single day. Look at this trade route. Now imagine how many cargo ships are dropping shipping containers into the ocean on a daily basis, and the components that are inside of these containers, I'm talking tennis shoes, cooking utensil, rubber ducks, plastic bags, anything and everything. This rubbish ends up finding its way to the shore and washing itself up on the beach, along with the rest of our trash. Now clearly, this is a really big issue, and no one person can solve it. But a way to contribute to it would be by purchasing more things from your local economy and less things from overseas."
1,alright guys she in versus princess p part six i have a feeling this is gonna be a good one okay this is the first top this is the one from princess poly it is very very cute i will say that um there's like a million different ways to wrap this top around on the website go see but this one was twenty dollars from princess poly this is the way that i wrapped it around and um he did get a lot of extra fabric back there so that's nice um now let's see the she in version alright y'all this is the she in version and i'm actually super impressed this was eight dollars granted the material is a little bit thinner and you get less fabric so there's like less ways to wrap it probably but i don't really care i think it's super cute twenty eight dollars versus eight dollars i might have to go with the she in version this time um this is like a more of a dull blue but still super pretty what do y'all think
1,"My sister and I were very bored. We wanted to shop, so we gave each other a 50 limit to spend on Shein for each other. We have no idea what we got. I still haven't looked. This is gonna be a surprise for me. Um, real quick, we have very different styles. Very different body types, but I'm awful. Let's go. This is a 1X, goes down on the floor. I'm 5'10"", so it's pretty good. I like it a lot. This is a two X, um, I scrunched it because the stomach is just... it's all out. You know, 'cause it's thin, doesn't really hold you, but um, it's really cute. I love moons. Love it, next up 1X body suit, 3X shorts. They're super long, like I kind of wanna roll them or something. Weird length but um, super comfy. Everything fits great. This tank top is a 1X, it fits really great. It's really thin but it does roll a lot. It's kind of annoying but I still like it so be right all the time. Last thing, extra extra large. I love being auntie, so I love this."
0,"I'm gonna like to call it a tipsy shopper, and the type of person has a couple of glasses of wine and gets a lot of courage and decides to buy a bunch of tank tops off of SHEIN that are probably not gonna be ever worn in public, but I'm gonna try them on. Not really sure where I thought I was gonna wear this. It's definitely not that backyard barbecue, so it definitely doesn't scream PTA meeting. You're not gonna go hang out with your mother-in-law in this, but it's kind of vibe. So, the lavender one makes it look like I'm nude, so we won't get to see that one. If you're pale, you should not get it. Alexa, play Shania Twain 'I Feel Like a Woman'."
-1,okay I think I've made my first Boo boo order machine so my little boy's birthday is coming up and he loves randomly he loves the Pixar lamp um you know the one that goes across the letters and jumps anyway he loves a Pixar lamp and I've tried to look for a Pixar lamp replica. I just cannot find one and when I was looking at Shein the other day and put an order in something else they had these lamps and it said it was a table lamp um and you can put your phone on it and it's good for studying with and it looks like the Pixar lamp so I ordered it come three different colours and I ordered it in white and it come yesterday is tiny and has the audacity to have a picture of a phone what kind of phone. Barbie's phone is going on that so I'm just gonna open it up so this is it and it will clip into there but I don't wanna clip it any case. I can't get it out so I wanna put it back in the box but this is the little lamp. I mean you can play with it you know that with his Disney figurines but that just really made me laugh he's so tiny and he even has like a phone holder that what phone are you putting on that and on the box it has the audacity to say do not direct the headlight into people's eyes. I don't even know if you oh it actually works so yeah that was my first little Shein fell maybe I should have looked at the measurements but when it had like a picture of a phone. I thought it was gonna be alright but I think he's gonna love it for his birthday but it just made me laugh like how teeny tiny is
1,"Okay, so I'm gonna do a quick try on haul, um, of some of the stuff that I got for my trip. Um, I hate getting dressed and undressed, so I'm probably just gonna show, like, the main things that I'm excited about, um, and maybe, like, the best things and some of the fails, if there are any. Hopefully everything works out. Okay, here's my first item. I love green on me. I think this is so cute. Actually,. I was a little bit nervous, but I think it came out really cute. Okay, here's the next two things I got. Um, the shirt is really cute, but these cups, like, really don't hold you in at all. And this one's, like, misshapen. The skirt could be cute, but it literally is just way too short. I just don't know how. I'm gonna even walk without my butt coming out. But it could be cute. And it's comfortable. Like, the material, it's stretchy. Just means a little bit more material down the back. Okay, I got this brown dress. That's, like, my pink one. It's cute, but I think it's see through, and it's just too tiny. Like, again, I don't know how I would be able to walk, but the pink one is, like, so cute. I just. We're not working out here. Okay, this one's a little hard to get into. I think it's really cute. It's a little bit see through also. I thought it would Be cute for a night out. Um, with, like, white boots. I'm just. I'm not sure. Is it too much? I don't know. I don't know if it's that flattering. What do you think? Okay, so I think the skirt ended up being pretty cute. Um, sure. I don't know. It just looks kind of cheap to me. I have that brown shirt, but I'm not gonna try that on because I pretty much already have that, and that's about it. When I get my Fashion Nova stuff,. I'll do a little haul of that, too."
0,okay totally outside of my comfort zone doing a little shopping lately and I'm just curious what the fuck is this what is this look at this. I don't know. I don't know guys I the fashion industry.

Everything today. My fan. My fan just came in today. And what does it matter now? I've seen Beyonce twice and didn't have this fan. I'm hot. That's why I had to buy a Fashion Nova dress. And then I had to through. Through it up. Just. I wouldn't look like every other in there. I'm annoyed. But look at my face. Skin flawless. No. No filter needed."

0,do y'all ever wear pants that you cannot bend over or sit down in but they're just so cute when you standing up so you wear them anyway and just suffer all day. I'll be having a salad for lunch
1,"The top is cute, okay? The top is eating, and the pants, by the way... Shein, how is this a small? How is this small and the junk huge? We gotta get this altered, that boy I stretch. Anyways, this top is cute; this is from Shein Basics."
0,"I just got my first ever Shein haul, yeah, first ever. But I ordered it all because I wanted this dress for my daughter, okay? And I read one of the comments; it said 'cute dress, but it's not real sequins, okay?' But my mind couldn't comprehend what 'not real sequins' meant. I definitely didn't think it meant this. I was like, 'It'll still be cute, maybe there's still not... maybe they're fake sequins? I don't even know what fake sequins are, but whatever.' My mind didn't comprehend that this dress would actually just be a cotton... a cotton dress, like it's not real sequins; it's a T-shirt, that's all it is. A T-shirt dress that looks like sequins, but you can see how cute it would be if it was real sequins, but no, not like this, not in real life. It'll photograph well, but not in real life, no thanks, fail. Okay, but this, this is cute, this is a keeper."
0,"Excuse the state of me, but I want to show you this top that I bought on Shein. And I do like it, but I'm not going to be able to use it for its intended purposes. And I'll show you why. Excuse the cat pajamas, but this is why I can't. Maybe I could wear it for like dates or something? Um, yeah"
1,"""Hi guys, I got a delivery today. If you want to stick with me, I'm gonna do a mini try-on and unboxing of some Shein items I ordered, just some sweaters and a couple of work outfits. So, let me know what you think. First up is this black sweater, which I actually love. And then coming up next are these olive green work pants, which ended up being one of my favorites. They're really thick and good quality, was pretty surprised at those. Now, these look deceiving, beautiful color, but those were super thin and you can't really see from the video. Um, and then the brown sweater for all of the freezing cold winter nights here in Florida. Now this black top, oh my gosh, wait until the end, I do try it on, and that one fits so well. And then this sweater, I was debating on, I'm not sure if I'm screaming grandma vibes or what, but let me know in the comments what you think. And of course, a classic off-white sweater, look at me trying to have a little fun with it, um, love the off-white, and I needed a classic, crisp white button-up, and this definitely did the job. Now, if you know me, you know I love, love lime green, one of my favorite colors, so I had to get that sweater. And then I love this pretend sweater to kind of give me that preppy girl look. So now, let's try all of this on. Bring in strong, is my favorite color, the lime green sweater, which came with an extra added hole, not sure what happened there, so this will be returned. So clearly, the sweater did not want to go back in the return bin, or return pile, um, I had a lot of fun trying to get it untangled from my earring, uh, love this classic off-white sweater, that was definitely a win, great quality. Okay, and so I'm living for this brown, sort of crop top turtleneck sweater, great quality, this one felt like a million bucks and look, it's hugging me in all the right places. And guys, I swear, I'm gonna have to post in the comments how much I spent on everything, but it was minimal, these items had to be like 12 each. Um, again, not loving the quality of the blue pants, but definitely love this look put together, maybe I'll have to find another color pant, similar but in better quality. Um again, fave, these olive green work pants are thick and they are comfortable, and look at this outfit I put together. So listen, guys, if you're really trying to find some good and inexpensive work items, make sure you read the reviews, but I highly recommend. So hope you guys enjoy, bye."
0,"Okay, so I just got in my Shein Halloween order. I didn't order for, like,. Halloween decorations and pieces for my Bellatrix Lestrange Halloween costume. I can't even hate. Most of it was good, but this is comical. And this is why you should read dimensions for things. I didn't. It's my. It's my fault. I'm not mad at Shein. I just think it's funny. This is what I ordered. Um, the way that they did it looks just like a normal size gourd, so thought I was getting a normal size gourd. This is what I got. It's is, like, smaller than the palm of my hand. It's my tippity baby gourd."

0,"Okay, last night. I was looking up western graphic tees on Shein, and I found some really unhinged graphic tees that I need to show you. I know that you will come wade through the stream in February, cross the early summer morning, jump over the mountains in late autumn, and then leave a long lamp in the cold winter night. Flying, love and peace. Never give up. Believe that the sky where pigeons fly is full of smiles, mystery. Be your own sun. You deserve better. Live for yourself. Give yourself a smile every day towards the sun. Last but not least, cashew flowers. Funny soul. Feel the collision. What does that even say? From any atmosphere.

1,"Super cheap room products from shein part 3. This is the best watch you will ever have in your life, it is a led watch. Maybe it doesn't look as cool because there's so much light, but it looks very cool in person. You can set an alarm, you can set the date and you can set a mode so that it does not change, it always stays the time, it also has a mode to turn it off at at night, that is, you turn it on, the light goes out, you sleep at ease and in the morning you turn it on again and the time and date are not deconfigured. That's right. I don't know how, but it also tells you the temperature,. I don't know how it measures it, but it tells you the truth. I don't remember how much it cost me, but it's super cheap.

0,well that was my first video with more than like 100 views so that's fun there does appear to be a little bit of concern and worry in the comments about like if I knew whether primark had changing rooms and you know why didn't I use the changing rooms and it's actually something. I really wanted to talk about and I wanted to be really honest with you guys and I cannot believe I've been saying this on the internet but it's because. I couldn't be fucking bothered

1,whoopsy daisy I slipped there's two bags there so I slipped twice hi I'm lizzy and I've been changing my life and bag myself a new job and I had no clothes to wear so I had a good old trip to primark let's see what I got part ���� going in strong with some gold hoops two pound reduce to one pound 50 can't go wrong starting off with this gorgeous black midi dress I freaking love it we got it in khaki too like imagine this with some heels so cute I love it. I've just ripped my bag just ripped it even more that was oh I got this casual black blazer which I love there was also a double breasted one that was a lot like thicker but that did not look good on a curvy gal can you show brows on TikTok let's find out they look an absolute mess but three for 15 quid and they're non wireless you literally no they're wireless you can't go wrong these are gonna be my McDonald's eating pants but they're gonna like masquerade is office there look at the stretch of these okay you can't tell but they're good although they're very long so heels are definitely needed. I'm returning this one this was a mistake it looks like a lovely normal white shirt but it's see through as. I'm continuously trying to figure out how to wear a shirt as a big boobed gal and I don't seem to learn that you just can't gape they're not ready you're not ready look at these shoes. I bought the wrong size returning and exchanging for the correct size cause look how pretty oh fuck primark pants can't go wrong stick on nails because we're having a bit of a moment with my actual nails which I will not show you on camera but it's in my last private video if you're not bothered. I always try and get on with the primark trousers and I can't get on with them they're horrible material they they don't come up true to some bullets around to be honest they're cute though that's everything I got
-1,"I have either been so smart or so dumb. I was in the pajama section of Primark the other day, and I came across these shorts. These are pajama shorts, but hear me out. I thought these would look so cute in the summer with, like, a little tank top. We have a little gingham pair, probably my favorite pair, the beige kind of colored one, and then this pair as well. Not tried them on. They're 4 50 each, so let's see if they're see through or not. I am literally praying that they look good. We'll start off with the gang on pair. Okay. Maybe these aren't the sleigh that I thought they were. Actually feel so bloated because I've just got my period, so that's fun. Yeah. I'm, like, wearing the wrong color top. I don't know. Maybe they're, like, shorter. Very real, very open right now. Um, these shorts are making my body dysmorphia today and my body image feel so bad. So incredibly bad. Um,. I just feel they don't do anything for me. I literally feel just so boxy. I just feel like they are too much like pajama shorts for them to look good. And I really thought I did something. You know, I. I really thought that I hacked the system. Cheat the system? Um, yeah, these are very much giving pajama shorts. Maybe someone cooler than me can make them look good, but on me, on my body type,. I don't Think so? I'm upset. And just for shits and gigs, here's the last pair. Yeah, safe to say that was a big, fat fail. I sincerely apologize about catfishing. You all really thought those shorts were gonna give Pinterest girly? Um, but clearly not. Instead,.

1,"I might have just released brand new bronzing drops. And this. This is a blush. Drunk elephant started the whole, like, bronzing drops trend. Gonna be honest, never gonna spend that. It's nice to see other products that, like different price points. So they're called the Instant Bronzing Drops by PS Pro. Two different shades they come in. So you have light medium, and there's also medium dark. 2 50. It says blendable drops for an instant glow. There's also hyaluronic acid and marula oil. I'm definitely not saying that. Right. That you can hear. They sound really liquidy. This the blush, and it looks like it's gonna be a pink. It's called the instant Blusher drops. Again, 3 50. Sounds like it's gonna be the same consistency. I got both shades because I think I'm gonna be a mix of the two shades. So this. Oh, god. Hello. No, I just can't straight away. This is light medium. Actually, that could. That could be me. I don't know how sheer they were gonna be, because, obviously, bronzing drops, essentially what these do, you can use them under your makeup, as your makeup, like, as your base. I know a lot of girlies will use this as their actual base. Like, people will check this on, go about their business, do what they gotta do. I think it's nice, though, to show you the both shades that they have right now so you can see it for different skin tones. This could be a bronzer shade for me. Before we start, just want to let you know. I'm feeling alright. Okay. I don't need that school wet paper towel. This is gonna channel the naturalness. I can't believe I'm saying that. This is what the girlies do. You know what's liquidy, but it's not like water. Oh yeah. I also picked up this. This Brush, Duo Fiber Bronzing Brush, 4. And I thought this could be nice to blend everything out with. Do you know what? It's kind of gold. The shine to it. It's got that like bronzy, almost like holiday glow, if that makes sense. This brush is molting a little bit, I think. I think I would probably pre conceal. You can see like scarring and stuff down here. It's definitely evened out the complexion. Definitely glowy. I'm looking a little bit glowy and a little bit hurry really quick. I'm just gonna take some my NARS pop concealer. This is what I use for breakouts. And just put a little bit on any scarring. Just pretend I've done this before. Yes. See, I would definitely pre conceal before because it just evens everything out. Because this is mostly glow for me. I don't know why. If I'm wearing something sheer and kind of glowy and it has like a slight tint to it, but doesn't really hold a lot of coverage. I feel like if I don't pre conceal, my skin always looks a little bit Patchy, a little bit muddy. Guys, this is actually drying down to touch. It doesn't have that sticky layer on the skin. You know, when it feels a little bit icky, it can be a little uncomfortable. Sometimes I actually can't feel this, which is a good sign, but I don't know if it's a bronze over the top of that, because I don't want to disturb whatever already done. Like, I don't know if that's a good idea, because it does dry a bit. Hmm. I'll do, like, a little bit. I don't think this is made for this, but, I mean, it's added a little something. I don't know if I'll do it again. Should we add a little tickle of concealer just on the under eye? Do you like how easy it is to check it on, though? Like,. I feel like this is a product that I would probably love. Like, say I'm going shopping with my sister in the morning or something, and I want something quick and glowy and just to make my skin look a little bit more alive. That's this product. Guys, I actually don't like this as bronzer look. It's like, don't bronze with them. Okay. Use them as an all over color. Time for the blush. Okay, let's do. Oh, okay. Nice. Oh, my God, that's so cute on the skin. It's picking up way more pigmented than I even thought it was gonna be. I thought it was gonna Shear out a lot. That glow. So the shimmer in it has made me look 10 times more glow. Now I almost look a bit sunburned. I quite like that. I'm gonna add my own cream bronzer quick, guys, just to finish it off. I feel like I need a little something on the edges. The natural face is going on. Who do I think I am? I don't know if I love it. I hate it. Maybe I need a little lip. Actually, these are kind of cute. Minus the brows. Of, like, everything else, I could do in five minutes. No sweat. There is definitely drying properties in this, though, so I would just watch that in terms of, like, layering your products on top. Tap the glow, and, like, the healthy skin complexion. 3 50. These two are going in my bag. I might just do this again."

This is from Primark, though, and it's 3 50 this is the Primark one and then this is the Maybelline Sky High the packaging like with the raised font and everything the dupe is still pink but it's the formula thought it'd be the perfect time to try some just piecing together my makeup now which is why I look a little crazy just to make sure we're all happy here I am gonna curl my lashes you can calm down just to make sure that lashes as lifted as possible to get the best result follow my lashes don't curl the best you know some people get like this insane curl but hang that's something let's check out the wands that plastic bristles or wand more of a wet formula that's the Primark one and then just for the shits and gigs that's the sky high I think the Primark wand is actually a little bit bigger it's got more like a gradient from top to bottom let me put them side by side see that slight shape difference between the 2. Gonna do the Primark mascara on this side right ignore the fact I've got mascara going everywhere I do like that one though can you see I can get right in that outer corner really easily like I can really comb through the lashes with it as well look at my lashes That's kind of crazy. Should I do a second? Just a little second one? Yeah, that's definitely thickened up those lashes. Personally,. I don't think I'll take it anymore than the 2 coats. Call me crazy, but I actually think I preferred it with the one coat. I think the second is to weigh down the lash slightly. Maybe that's a personal preference, though, because I don't like them to look too thick some gigs. Let's do sky high on the other side, just to see now. I love this mascara. Actually one of my favourite mascaras. Okay, that's one coat. That is the second coat. What do we think? I think it looks the same. You already know we're gonna do the bottom ones too. Quick. Okay. Primark side, sky high side. Here are both the lashes side by side so you can compare the 2. I did just go in and quickly give my lashes a curl, like really gently, just to make sure they were as like as possible. What do you guys think now? Personally? Okay. Do I think both lashes look great? Yeah. Do I think both the lashes look very similar also? Yes. If I'm being really picky, maybe the Maybelline side is a little bit more separating. Keep in mind that these are both drugstore mascaras, though, so they're both really affordable. Guys, Maybelline. Sky High has always been a drugstore favourite of mine, but this Primark one. 3 50 listen I like Both. But i'mma let you do the math, okay?"
0,"This store pays 3000000 euros per month in rent, is the store of primark, a low-cost clothing brand. It is on the third busiest street in europe, here on gran via in madrid and is the largest store. and most visited in this country. But the craziest thing about this story is that the rent is paid to one of their biggest enemies, to amancio ortega,. Sara's owner, who also owns this building, did you know? And. yes. you like to learn more about business in the world, follow me."
0,Aisha Nicole Smith hi give me 20 grand to slide up inside instead of Jesus. I'm a little bitch so I'm a little bitch are you sure the glass
1,"So embarrassing story. I tripped and fell today into primark. Listen, I take zero responsibility cause my sister wanted to go in there. She wanted to get the Ritaura Primark cardigan. The support sister I am. I went with her, um, tripped and fell into the, uh, checkout. And here we are. So. Hi, Michael. Okay. These jeans, these are sick. How cool are these? They're like a cargo style. Almost like washed denim, high rise. These were 18. Cute little crop tops, trainers, that kind of thing. Bit of me. This top they also had in black as well. They didn't have my size in black, but they did in the pink. How cute is this? It's like a top cardigan hybrid. With that cute little fluffy collar to top it off. The fairy bits. Removable. I wanna wear it tight like a top. Like nice and fitting with like a cute bra underneath. Maybe like a denim skirt. That would look nice. 14 and I got a 2 XS. These are the ultimate autumn winter boot. Are you kidding? These are part of the Rita Oracle Club. And I just think they're so cool. The chunkiness, the heel high. It's like a dressy a boot. Are they just not like the ultimate coolest Bagby boot? Teddy slippers? I feel like everybody needs them. They're too cute. These are actually a repurchase for me because I did get them in the large. I am normally a medium, but I Got the large cause I tried them on in store and they felt very comfortable and the right size. They did stretch, so I needed to get the size now. So now I actually now make it 6 pounds. By the way, this might not be everybody's cup of tea, but I thought it'd be really sweet with like little jeans and stuff. It's a little knit cropped jumper. But it's got all these little pearls over it. I don't know if you can see that. Or even some nude leggings that would look nice. I got it in a medium. And this was 16. I'm a sucker for knitwear this time of year. Giving it wear anything and in my element. Primark pajamas. Sorry. For the best this time of year. I don't wanna hear it. We're not debating these ones. The wide leg shirt combo are my favourite. I've got these in so many colours now, but I think this is a new style. It's the black with the little peach hearts. I got size extra small and they're 15 pounds. Trust me, you will live in them. You won't regret it. No, because this picture, the scenes, girlies, you're on your period, okay? The pains are paining and you need some comfort. What are you gonna use? The pink hot water bottle. But it's not just any pink hot water bottle. This is literally like a cylinder. The hot water bottles at the back. So you can Put your arms in this. I've never seen one like this. It was 8. Gonna keep me warm and my womb. I mean, what more could I possibly want? I also picked up a couple of hoodies. These ones are my two favourites at the moment. Look at the Hello Kitty one. So it's just baby pink hello Kitty on the front, nothing on the back. It's one of the thick ones. I thought they have a couple of different versions in Primark. They have, like, their thicker, more structured ones and they have their thinner ones. I get the extra small small. And this was 26. That teddy fleece material. Don't you just wanna snuggle in that? And then I also got the green Bambi one. How gorgeous is the colorway of this? And Bambi. It's so cute. I feel like Molly Mae needs this. Molly 27. It was random home pickup, but I smell this and it smell amazing. It's the vanilla bean and mint brim spray. This one I'm gonna keep in the bedroom and I'm gonna spray on, like, the bedding and stuff. And I say, this literally smells like a perfume. I mean, this smells like a perfume. It's more vanillary, but, like, you get the hint of mint, so it smells really fresh. 4 50. So I always like to browse in the jewelry section, and I picked up a few little new earrings. This cute little kind of melted metal pair in gold. This was 2 50 and then almost like a bigger version of them. These were 3 50. I thought like, these would make a really cool statement earring. 3 50 little floral hoops. So like, these were really, really sweet. And then these ones I'm wearing now, these cute little textured hoops. They come in silver and gold. It's like a pack. It's part of the Reed's Oracle lab. I also picked up the vitamin enriched moisturising primer, but the pink versions. This is for breast cancer. So I thought report. And finally these two headbands. I've not tried them on yet, so. Suit me a nude. Kind of stretching it with the J on. This was 4. They also have this in a gray as well. And then this groovy black and white one. This was 4 50. Just like in the winter. I love a headband. I feel like you could wear that. Don't laugh. Is that how you wear these? I don't know. I guess you could also wear them like a normal headband too. Thicker. The tag is really doing it. Ha ha ha. So like,. I see guys do this. That looks really cute on them. They don't look nice. Anyway. That's my little primark call."

0,"I went shopping yesterday, so I'm going to show you everything I bought. I went to the casing house, primark and arenal, okay? At primark, the first thing I bought was a sponge, this one is already wet, okay? It's not that big, okay? You know I use this one, which is so big from shein, that this one, if you wet it, it looks bigger, and well I saw this one in primark and I said,. I'm going to take it to try it, and I like mine better, this one is already wet, and this one you still wet it and they get bigger, that is to say that compares sizes, but well, to make the fix, well, that's fine, okay? Then I bought this bottle of stitch, which I saw and said, uh, it doesn't get any prettier. Oh,. I can't get this off. Well, whatever, it doesn't get any prettier. And I said for me to take to class, to leave here on the dresser, which is smaller, although I have my 2L bottle, which I am but well, a never hurts the collection again, okay? I also took this body oil, which has like glitter,. I don't know if you see it here, glitter, glitter, and I had already seen it some time ago, but here in the primark in vigo things arrive, em, who knows which one, when in other places they remove them to put new ones, here it arrives, and well, yesterday I saw it. and I said that I have to take it with me because it's today or never, and I already have it, okay? I also bought these 2 little bottles, which I have one,. I don't know if you already know, with make-up removal, and you fill it and squeeze it and that's it, and that's it. we needed more little bottles to put here on the dressing table, more practical, and well, it's worth 1 and it's great. I had another one, but, uh,. I gave it to my mother, okay? I also took this mirror that worked in primark, mine,. I don't know why it doesn't work,. I don't know if it will be defective, and this is supposed to illuminate, you're supposed to open it and it has light, but but the light,. I don't know where it is, it went, but,. I mean,. I don't know,. I mean, it's I turn here and I don't understand,. I don't know,. I have to see how I do to make it work, but no, it doesn't go. I also took these makeup remover wipes that I needed for my headdress, to keep here, and when I need them,. I have a makeup remover wipe and there is one thing, okay? I always went to primark and saw some vanity cases with my initial. I was never, ever, ever. If it was, it wasn't in a color I liked. I went to primark yesterday and found this, the complete kit must be with my initial. I said I have to take it because it's now or never. And this is useful for many things, to save for when you travel, so it is very necessary. And so it was this one so bigger, this one in tiny which is so thinner. And this one is bigger that they were never and they were just yesterday in pink with my initial, something, something. Fate was telling me. And I really can't be happier. I just can't be with you anymore. Then at the arenal I bought this mascara that I've wanted to try for a long time, which they say is very good. And the first one from sky high, which turns out everyone knew I was out but me. And I'll make a video trying it because I want to try it, really. Finally, in the house of cases I got these cell phone cases, these with the initial, because they never have my initial, so there is,. I have to take advantage of this one which is harder but softer this way. I love how it looks with the phone, because I also got a white protector. and it looks really good. And so that's all I bought myself. I was going to get my nails done and in the end you can leave me anything you need on my instagram."
0,But did you know that the tag they give you from primark is used to close the dressing room.
1,The other day we brought from Primark this marvel that is to go on a picnic and measures one 35x1. 50 and let's see how it is It comes with this correta so you can hang it when you go to the beach Vale We open it from here that comes with the Velcro so it stays up and Tara. Hey just in case it's bigger than it looked eh. Heh heh Ole what a good eh. Very good ready?
0,"Today. Oh, my God, what is that? Oh, my God, what is that?"
0,back again with more Primark dupes starting off with this concealer which is the truth for the Maybelline Instant Anti age erasers and it comes in various different shades next we have these eyeshadow primers which are the dupe for the urban decay eyeshadow prime potion here we have the Charlotte Tilbury dupes even the applicator is the same and as well as the shades finally the Charlotte Tilbury Flaws filter dupe let me know if you'd like to see a full face of dupes
1,"New Primark haul, so I picked up a few bits again. Girls. I got this beige dress and wow, it is just giving skims vibe. It looks so cute on, especially for 14. Perfect for a night out. Then I got this cute little jumper and these leather shorts. I put my Chanel belt on with it and bag just to dress it up. I love this for, like,. London shopping day. I got this beige Co that was only 28 and this big scarf. It's giving very autumn pumpkin patch vibes, and I just think it looks really expensive on. I got this cute little skirt and also this little jumper. What has a shirt detached? I did tie this at the back so it's more fitted. Then I got this little jacket and skirt. Paired this with my Fendi stuff. Let me know what you think of the looks."
-1,they are Zara. I do not recommend them at least for my powerful capped girlies website it's my own fault website didn't say anything about caster conference but I thought I would just take a chance and maybe the gods would smile on me no such luck. I could not get them past the middle of my life and I do think they look like upon closer inspection a bit cheaper because they were only 89 so I knew it was too good to be true however if you do have thinner lights. I would give them a go because I really like the how the heel is both slender there and wide there so you can walk on it and the squaring of the toe just feels really modern to me and silhouette wise is pretty much exactly what I'm looking for of course with all the fast fashion caveats they're probably not really great quality and I don't think they'll last that long but if you need something under 100 and your legs will fit them then give them a go my legs are 15 and 12 inches wide at the widest part of the circumference if that helps you with thinking of if your legs will fit them without fully measuring the circumference of this boot. I would say that if your calves are bigger than 14in in circumference they're they're not gonna fit so don't waste your money in that case these are them just search kneeld kneeled heeled knee high boot on Zara and give it a try. I don't I don't recommend them
-1,I hate online shopping so I ordered this dress in a size small and let me show you what it looks like on so this is the dress. I just yeah I think I look like a tablecloth to be honest. I don't know it just on the model it looked shorter and it just didn't look this poofy it's like a lot of poof so if you want to get it I suggest sizing down because the back is adjustable so you can tie this up or down as you want and same with like around the waist but personally I'm gonna have to return this
-1,welcome to part  of my primark haul part   was an epic fashion fail. I have high hopes this huge mongoose bag of accessories and home and things I like me some bougie sunglasses right I like big ones. I think they're wonky obviously I'm sure they used to be 80p I got a hair clip so I can put my hair up. I got a pair of trainers maybe theyll make me go walking why is there a stain best not to ask got a little baking dish cause it was pink. I bake sometimes ah ah ah. I'm gonna keep it on for the rest of the haul I do like a fun side plate. I also got a candle smells of something it doesn't say a I got a plant pot might paint this or spray it last up is I don't remember buying two candles oh this one's real cute smells a bit like an old lady if I'm honest thanks for watching have a great day bye
-1,after three long hours we finally made it to the front of the line oh my god
-1,"I'm almost at my favorite part. hold on and let by. damn, this shit is hard to come dead ass right now. yeah, I don't buy this shit from Shein. don't buy this. look, it's cute. don't buy it. thank God they're not like, paying me. wow."
-1,"Hey, TikTok, it's my birthday, and I have a really fun story to share. So it's not a strip club story, but it is still really funny. I went into Lululemon yesterday. I went looking around because I actually like their stuff. I had one bra of theirs for, like, years, and I actually just used it more like a bralette, because let's face it, if you have a big chest, um, their stuff really isn't gonna be supportive. I love their leggings. I love their tank tops that are, like, looser fitting like their jackets. I really can admit their stuff is good quality. It's expensive as hell, so it should be. Um, but their bras are lacking. They're not meant for women with anything bigger than a D cup, really. Maybe even a C cup,. I would argue. But anyway, if you see my previous videos, you know, I got. I got girls this doesn't really even. They don't even look as big as they are here. But I have other videos. You can kind of see that. Anyway, I walk up to 2 associates. It's a black man and a white looking girl. Okay, she did look kind of like a basic white girl, but I don't get canceled. So I'm say looking, because to me, that is how she looked. So I walk up to them and I say, Hey,. I really like your guys'sports bras. They fit me more like bralettes because I do have a Bigger chest. And I was wearing, like, pretty much, like, a sports bra that I was using as a shirt, kind of. And I'm like, See? I go, I have a big chest, but I do have a smaller waist. I've recently lost a lot of weight, and I don't know my size exactly. And tell me why. The girl looks at me and go,. I was like, you know,. I know you guys aren't really, like, big Tata friendly, but I want to see if you guys have anything. And I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just being realistic. I know what fits my body, and I know my shape, and I know their clothes. And the girl looks at me and goes, oh, no, we have something for all shapes and sizes. And, you know, we have some really good crop pants and this and that. I stopped her. I'm like, I'm sorry. What? I go, honey, you need to listen. I said, I'm looking at tops. I pointed to my chest. Why are you talking to me about pants? That's not what I'm here for. And she gritted her teeth and had to walk away because she wasn't helpful. And I'm sorry. If you're a retail associate, as soon as a customer comes walking up to you, and I'm not rude when I know I have your attention, obviously, if I can tell they're doing something,. I say, excuse me. I am actually very polite. I'm Like, excuse me, um, I have a question. Whatever. So I make sure I have their attention. I don't just ramble off and start talking if they're, like, on a headset or something or talking to a manager, like I do have. I used to work retail, so I get it. But the fact that she completely ignored what I said when I had her attention and she suggested something. Something completely off. Lululemon do better. Like, have your employees actually be educated on what's realistic for someone when they tell you what they're looking for. That's it. You guys have a great day. Bye. Bye."
-1,y'all my comm might have showed me the worst ap replica of all time you ready?  these shein pants. they are ap print replica shein pants is that angelic pretty on the booty? yeah that's angelic pretty on the booty apparently it did not sell well it is currently on clearance for 6.75 they have every single size from XS to XL available and the reviews are not great apparently they're made out of a spongy material that is used to make children's flame retardant sleepwear um and the waist is too big so um maybe don't buy this unless you wanna make some angelic pretty tote bags I don't know
-1,"Clothes in Zara that give me the ick as a stylist include sweaters with holes like this one. I can't believe this is 50. Denim shirts with bedazzling and weird design features that make no sense are also on the list. Cream dresses without any lining are hard to see on the phone, but you can literally see my entire hand through this. If it's super wrinkled on the rack, it's going to look even worse when you start to sit down and actually live in the garment. Trendy boots that won't be in next season, jackets without lining that won't keep you warm, and super thin buttons that feel paper-thin and cannot hold big boobies are all things I avoid. Another example of unsupportive buttons, fabric that looks cracked, more cracked fabric, a spray paint hoodie, and the thinnest trousers on planet Earth are also no-gos. I'm not kidding; if you have cellulite and don't want to wear an undergarment, you will be able to see it in these trousers."
-1,"all right. ultimately, this is the best I could come up with is a little black dress. I didn't like anything else. I hate this outfit. I, like, absolutely devastated that my dress didn't come because I wanted to be more sparkly. it is what it is. my hair curls came out pretty good. necklace, diamond earrings, just a pair of, like, sparkly black heels. best I could do. I'm devastated over the dress thing, but it is what it is."
-1,"Cousin, what the hell? Walk it off, Lululemon. I'll say it clear."
-1,"I just searched for bikinis and beach sliders on Shein. This is what has come up. Now I don't know whether to laugh or be extremely concerned about the 100 people that have purchased this and rated them 4.93 stars. Not only that, but they actually come in two different colours. This is giving foot fetish like in the most disturbing way. And just when I thought things couldn't get worse, this was another option and literally somebody just bought these. Who are buying these shoes? What in the waffle cone is this? Oh, that's enough Shein for one day. No, no, no, no, no."
-1,"y'all,. I'm done fucking with them. and because they're messing with my mind. what am I supposed to do with this? it. what am I supposed to do with this? oh, it covers one boob."
-1,what was the reason?! please look at this why y'all Shein better count their fucking days
-1,"I didn't wanna bring more attention to this situation. I just wanted to address a couple of things. that's what funky is about, and I wanna know what you guys think. but this whole show had nothing to do with London Fashion. London Fashion Week dismissed it. they said, this has nothing to do with it. pretty little thing, we're just trying to market itself to fit in. London Fashion Week. and the whole thing just left a. a really sour taste in my mouth, because, yes, they showed some great diversity, but I felt like that was almost done. it was almost done in a way. to manipulators like brainwashing us to think, oh, this is a positive thing, whilst perpetuating fast fashion and encouraging it and greenwashing again. announcing that pretty little thing are gonna do a marketplace where you can rebuy pretty little thing. I am. that is still low quality, unethically made, unsustainable. and they continue to push this one where mindset. I guess that's just what we expect from pretty little thing now. and now, because they're up in their prices, up in and up in them, there isn't even that excuse that I buy from pretty little things. it's cheap. that is all I've got to say. but what do you think?"
-1,"Okay, because I don't know why, but every Shein eyeliner I get, it does this. Every single one. So annoying. By the way, this is how the look came up."
-1,"Okay, so I just realized why, for the past, on those 20 years of me living, my mom is always like, let me see the substitute you ordered. And then she gives me her feedback right before I order them and buy them. And it's usually really good feedback. Like, those bottoms look like they're kind of small. Okay, no, I didn't ask this year. I didn't think about it. Right. I just kind of went for it. Let me show you this. Hold on. What are you supposed to do with this? Like, this is the front. Where is everything going? Where is everything going, girl? I don't know. Okay, this is the. This is honestly the worst one. Okay, there's that one, there's this one. But this is worse than pink underwear. Okay, this is worse. This is way worse. Oh, no, I'm not wearing that. I'm aware of that. So. I'm just really confused on where, like, where's the boundary of, like, this. This is too small. Like, all. She doesn't even show the real pictures of the back. Okay? You don't even know until you get it, and then you're like,. I didn't know. Some suits are just gonna keep getting smaller. At least the bottoms. But."
-1,"hey, babes. my name is Annalise and I buy the world's weirdest clothing items so that you don't have to. and recently, for a YouTube video,. I bought the weirdest items that I could find on Shein. and this was one of those items. so let's put it over this is what the dress looks, like, on. and I just have so many questions because, like, already it's such a weird desire to have this massive cut out feature up here. that is so long. that look, my boobs popping out and my underwears almost showing. and then she said, oh, no, that's not enough. let's add this really weird bottom half as well for Shein. that still wasn't enough because they added these really weird pink blanket material sleeve. I just do not understand. out of all the weird items I bought on the internet. I definitely think that this takes the cake. cause, like, who is really buying this and wearing it? I really wanna know. I really wanna know"
-1,"Um, so I got a pair of jeans that I ordered. What are these? I have a grandpa ass. Why? What is it? These are so unflattering. Oh, no. Baby's mad, but. Yep. Whoa. Built like a fucking board."
-1,"If you've ever ordered from Shein or thinking about ordering from Shein, you need to watch this. So I recently just redid my room, repainted the whole thing. I have nothing on my walls. And I ordered a bunch of stuff from Shein. I ordered a rug,. I ordered new posters, fake flowers, a bunch of stuff. And I want to show you what I got versus what I ordered. First, I ordered nine fake flowers. They sent me three. Let's start there. Next, I ordered a rug, and I'm not the best with math, but I know when things are not right. And the measurements are totally off. And I wanna show you the difference between this 80 by 1 20 rug and my 80 by 1 20 rug that I already have. I'm not gonna lie, the quality is not terrible. Like, I think it's pretty good quality, but are you kidding? Like, if that's 80 by 1:20, and that is too, like, something's totally off. And for my favorite part,. I have a single bed. I measured it. This should be 100 by 1:50. I don't know what this is, but there's no way, like, yeah, that's. That's gonna fit on my whole bed. No, shein, I am extremely disappointed and do not order. Disclaimer that this is probably my fault for trusting Shein, and, yeah, it's just my fault. Next, I ordered a few posters, and, like, this one, it's hard to unroll, but this one's Cute. Like, that one's good. This one's good, too. But this one's, like, dirty. Like,. I don't know if you can tell, but on the bottom, like, that's like dirt. So I also didn't know about all the things going on in Shein and that they're getting shut down. And I would have totally not ordered if I would have known those conditions. And I'm not gonna do this again. So learn from my mistake. Bye."
-1,i'm literally about to cry i haven't ordered anything online in over a year. And you tell me the first thing that i buy is this and it looks horrible okay like it would not look bad if it was up here but then if it's up here hellooo like this thing doesn't even look good it's not supposed to be like that. Alright i can tell you now no hysterical fake cry. Atleast it was eight bucks
-1,"shein, shein, shein. whatever your name is, I got a bone to pick with you. the fuck is this? this is supposed to be a medium, baby. what part of this is a medium? this is an eye patch, okay? this is an eye patch. this is not a medium. this is not a size 6. no part of this is a size 6, baby. like, you got me out here looking like a bust. a can of biscuits. you want all my lady bits to be falling out everywhere? and this is how you're supposed to wear the top? mind you, this is a medium. this is a size 6 according to your website. the fuck?

0,on the hunt for a blue maternity dress for my brother's wedding. A friend suggested SHEIN. I chose these three dresses to see if they would work. Dress 1 in navy was way too tight in the chest. It could work in a bigger size. Dress 2 had cute details in the back but serious nightgown vibes. Dress 3 was so exposing in the chest that I had to stuff a white sports bra just to post this. What other site should I check out?

0,"Things I wouldn't buy in shein,. I am going to show you what things. I personally would not buy and have never bought. in shein. This is my personal opinion of myself. You can do whatever you want with your money and buy whatever you want. This is just my opinion. So for starters, very nice makes him a very nice figure, super summery colors, all good, but since I've been seeing those prints, since I've been seeing those sleeves, automatically me buying on shein. I know they are from shein. And it's not wrong for you to know it's shein's, but in shein there are many things to buy. Have you seen that I have a superviral video? I think the most viral for the clothes I bought that eh in shein that people ask me the codes, they ask me even when I change where they are from. So I don't buy this type of clothing because it simply is like ordinary, the normal. What everyone is looking for in shein, are even the most economical, that's why everyone has it another one. Look gentlemen, ever since I've been watching this kind of manga, of that transparent little bump here, with these little pearl dots, these pearls around here too, and this sleeve and this set that I think everyone has it,. I don't know why and it's nice as I say, at least that set. I like it, but I have seen so many on instagram and well-known people who have it that it is an absolute no these clothes, my mom loves this type of and every time he sends me eh,. I like that I buy it, shall I tell you no? Because even I know it's from shein, from a distance it can be seen that it is from shein. I don't like to be identified all at once. and there are people who do like it because of an example, buy a louis vuitton, so to speak, so to speak, a brand everyone wants them to know that she is a louis vuitton. because shein is not because it is shein, what happens is how is that account. That page is economic because it has to be said, compared to the others no need to search the economic things they have and open your mind, search. I know not everyone eh, follow the fashion, but there are many things eh, until simple that you can create a super cute outfit, that people don't even know it's from shein. That kind of manga were among the first eh clothes than shein,. I mean, when shein started everyone and who had that kind of manga. I got to have it. I did buy one of these, but since I started to see than many people around me, that in the networks everyone has the type of. I don't like it that everyone has the same clothes as me. That is my opinion. Remember,. I don't like people having my own clothes that I make. I never buy it. To me that kind of clothing doesn't exist in my cart, it doesn't even appear in my eh. They have a section that is like the things you look for and they throw at you the sort of thing you are looking for. None of that kind of clothing shows up. I had to search good to have them appear to me because I don't even get them because I don't look for them. Don't kill me for saying or share my opinion, because maybe there are many people who think the same as me. This is simply a set. My sister sent it to me these days who was going on a trip. I said, don't you dare why? Because it's very nice. I told him. Everyone has that one, that set. In other words, everyone dies because I have seen it too much. In other words, in this presentation of a single mirror and in this one that the 2 have and can say, but it's nice. We're not talking about ugly shein stuff. We are talking about things I would not buy because everyone has it, because it is a clothing that is from since I washed someone. I say, those clothes are shein's, those shein clothes, those shein clothes. I don't like. This dress is the same with sleeves and pearls,. I hate it, it looks cheap. You understand what I mean. This there is no concert, there is no concert. That for the -15 have it, for God's sake, so many nice clothes, so many options to go to a concert and you all go bread with the same. The little vanilla is cherry on top of some cargo pants and. Open your mind. That was my selection. As I tell you, don't take anything personal, not that you can't buy it because I said so. and I am nobody,. I am simply sharing my opinion here on my social networks. I love shein,. I buy a lot in shein, you know it, but I always try to look for things that are not there. very cheap,. Not very expensive either because we're going to be realistic. That's why I buy on shein, because it's cheap, but neither. I like to buy the things that everyone has, that they are clothes that I have seen from many people that are even viral. There are many more clothes. I didn't put it here because imagine, won't I last? 10 minutes or more talking about things. than not buying in shein. That's simply my opinion of things as they are also a no for me and nothing. That was all. I've already had my skincare, look at my hair,. I had hair surgery. Within the week I will upload a video of the process."
0,"how many calories you supposed to eat to lose weight? I will show you quickly how to calculate that. step 1, write your current age, height and weight. step 2, Calculate your basic metabolic rate. use this formula as an example. I will use my measurements and BMR shows you how many calories your body needs to maintain the basic functions without including any activities. step 3, Multiply your BML with the activity factor. choose one of the factors. most of my clients are career driven full time work and busy women who don't have much time. so their activity factor is usually 137 or 155. step 4. You need to choose your goal. do you want to lose weight, maintain or gain. most of women want to lose weight. so to make that happen, you need to be on the small calorie deficit. healthy recommendation is to cut around 15 of your calorie needs. we use me as an example. so if to maintain weight,. I supposed to eat 2 000 calories and I want to cut 15. it means that I supposed to cut 300 calories. which means that my calorie deficit is around 1700 calories. but remember it's not only about the calories. the balance between protein, fat and carbs is crucial. plus you need to have enough of micronutrients in your diet. and remember quality matters."

0,"There are some men's fashion trends that just really need to be talked about, and even though the speaker doesn't feel qualified, no one else seems to be starting the discourse, so they feel compelled to step in. These trends fall under what the speaker humorously terms ""top man core."" The first one mentioned is the moto pant, which gets a slit in its eye and says that he's part of this fashion trend. Additionally, the speaker touches on individuals who find ways to say the n-word while rapping along to Mac Miller, indicating a problematic aspect of cultural appropriation within certain fashion trends. They also critique the whole look of such trends, suggesting they should be illegal, with a specific mention of the round-toed Chelsea boot. The speaker goes on to describe a person who claims to be an entrepreneur but has never started a business, always talks about intelligence, has ""rising grind"" in his bio, but seemingly has never read a book in his entire life. They also mention a type who claims to be a photographer but only takes photos of a certain type of women, suggesting that at that point, it's not art. Or, this person draws very realistic photos of lions, which supposedly implies a lack of taste. The speaker concludes with a sense of resignation or perhaps a sarcastic acknowledgment, saying ""Um yeah,"" as if to express their dismay or disbelief at these trends and behaviors."

I'm gonna try to book an appointment tomorrow to get, like, maybe four or five inches cut off, because my hair just needs it. Right now. My hair looks really greasy, and I promise you it's not. I literally showered and washed my hair two days ago. It was, like, in the evening, too, so it really should not be this greasy, which is annoying. Hair is done, and I love how these give me, like, a little bit of volume. Now it's time for shoes. You know, I had to finish the pink moment, so I Will be going with my pink hokas.

I also got my toes done, but I may have tripped and fallen into my, well, these bags from today with this was from the other day. but I'm just gonna show you them both. let's dive into today bag. I'm so happy. about this if you know, you know, this stuff is literally like gold dust. I've been to so many primarks. literally far away from me near me couldn't find it anywhere. and then I saw loads sat in my local primark. and I was like, my my local Primark has this. what, my local Primark is not that good. like, we have some good stuff, but we never really have the new stuff. but I grab 2, cause I was scared that it was gonna sell out. haven't even tried it. so we're gonna see if it's any good, in case you don't know. this is meant to be a dupe for the Bobby Brown enriched face base. I think it's called. I'm so happy. I finally got this dress. satin dress. dimonte straps. I saw this in a different Primark, but they didn't have my size. I got a size 4, but the only thing is with satin dresses, they never fit me. so I'm gonna have to get this tailored. but I just cannot get it. that was 15. I don't feel like it's 5 15 love and this is Jumper. and I've wanted this one for so long. although they only had a small. I wish I sized up. but you know, when you see something you like, you grab it anyway. girls, they have a brown seamless short set. I saw someone post on TikTok that they had these if you watch my videos. you know, I love anything fluffy and comfy. so I had to get the Grinch is an OD. I don't know what it is. I think this is actually the kids size. because I wanted it smaller. I don't like them too oversized because I just get a bit claustrophobic. you know, my boyfriend actually pointed this out in Primark. and I thought to myself, this is why my boyfriend. because this is just me. I absolutely love that oversized blazer. some loafers and chunky trainer. also can do a Bratz inspired outfit with that thongs standard. and then some phone gloves. I also got some batteries and a pen for my new book. got this massive super soft and comfy blanket for my boyfriend's car. in case we get cold. you know, if we're just chilling in the car. talking and stuff. I need to be warm. I literally cannot be present anywhere if I'm cold. last thing I got was the Primark contour sticks. whenever I see these,. I always stock up again. this colour is gold dust. this is in chai. I don't like as foundation. I feel like it just sits weird on the skin, but other cream contour so, so good. and it's only 2 50"
1,okay so it's super windy and cold looking and it's gonna rain so let's pick an outfit for Pilates instead of running go with this tank these leggings okay this is cute and then I'm always super cold when I start so I'm gonna wear this sweatshirt it's like the coziest thing ever it's not mine it's cj's but I've stolen it.

1,"Skiing in 2 weeks. And I've done some serious damage on PLT Ski. So we could go through it all together. I actually ordered from PLT Ski last year. A little bit skeptical at first because I thought, PLT Ski, is it gonna be waterproof? Is it gonna be warm? And oh, my god, it was so nice. Probably didn't need a new one. But when I saw this, I just thought, you're coming home with me. So here we are. Obviously, the theme is pink. How nice is that? Oh, my god. So we've also got a jumper to go underneath that. They only had an extra small in this, but I actually think that it's gonna fit me think they're gonna fit as well. Maybe I should have got an extra small in these. Off we have the jacket. I am obsessed. Look at that. It is just so nice. This is what I mean when I tell you. I have gone overboard a little bit. We have some new boots. The problem is. Oh, me and my boyfriend are sharing a suitcase, so that's his half gone. I'm gonna try everything on now. She is a little bit tight. It is stretchy. Like, it's got a lot of stretch in it. With these kind of ski suits,. I don't like it when they look baggy. Anyway, we are fully in. Is so nice. It has got a puffy lining, so I think it'll be really warm. Definitely. Hit the slopes in this. It's just so stretchy. Now for the jacket. This is the finished look, and I'm absolutely obsessed. I actually just want to wear this every single day. I genuinely have nothing bad to say about this. So if you need a nice ski outfit, then run to PMT"
1,"Hi, guys. Asher just got a package in the mail from his grandpa in Florida, and I have to give you a haul because everything is so cute. Everything's from Ralph Lauren.

1,"After uni I went directly to primark. Because on my for you page were so many videos with things that are there, which are just really cool. Then it started. I found directly really nice bikinis.

So really,. I love the full of the Victoria secret cube here and then also so really cute underwear. The set was My highlight and I show you all the stuff in the next video that I Mir."
1,hello it has been a while um I've had nothing to say which is why I haven't came on to give any updates. I am on holiday at the minute and last month obviously didn't work out for me so um yesterday I went shopping and I went to Ralph Lauren Kids which is a shop I'm absolutely obsessed with and and because I have no kids of my own. I spoiled my cousin and my friends future baby she's due in like end of September short of October time so I'll just show you what I got so these are some of the first things that I got just t shirts just plain t shirts 12 months which will actually probably fit him now because he's quite chubby so yeah I got that one. I got this one and I got just plain blue. I don't know why I'm obsessed with Ralph Lauren. I think it's mostly the polo polo bear and the bear that they have on their clothes but that is like a more expensive option so um that's why I just got these plain ones but then I did get some with the bear on it um which I'm gonna give him for Christmas so let me grab those so this one came as a two piece set. I didn't actually know this button that like that. I don't like that sort of pattern with buttons but I like this one um I like them both. I just wish that that wasn't button there but whatever um so I'm gonna give this to him for Christmas so he'll be one on Christmas Eve um so I feel like this might fit him then because as I said he is quite chubby um yeah so I got him these and then I got also this one just again playing um. I love yellow on him yellow is definitely his color. I love yellow on boys um. I just think it just brightens up. I just think it brightens them up because like you often see boys just wearing blue or like darker color so I love when boys wear yellow and I actually also love pink on boys but I can't buy pink for other people's boys because a lot of people won't put pink in their boys but if I have a boy he will be wearing pink and then last of all. I got him this um. I have a feeling that I've already got him this but not in T-shirt like in a jumper form or sweater sweatshirt. I don't know um yes I love the wee bear he. I think it's so cute. I think that's what I love about the Ralph Lauren designs um so that's all I got for him. I wanna get him one more thing and a shop called roots which is I believe a Canadian brand um. I got him last year. I got me and him matching with jumpers both purple um but I don't think his parents or anyone is a fan of the purple even though the set like it it was um merchandise as a family set so like to like the men jumpers women jumpers children jumpers they were all the same kind of purple um I love it on him but people are funny about that kind of stuff but not me okay so I got this for my friend as I said she's due around October and September. I absolutely love it like I just love it. I don't know why it's just more or less a basic plain pink jumper with are we blue thing on it but I love it. I think it's cute and I know she likes the more plain things so I hope she likes it too um I actually had almost a meltdown when I was shopping in the Garrid section because if I haven't mentioned before if you don't know. I really really want a Garrid like a baby Garrid and I was just sad because I couldn't get any of it for myself but the way I think of it is when they're finished with it they'll give it to me I hope not to say that I'll probably need it cause I'm gonna obviously go on my own shopping spree but it's nice to think of um anyway this is the second thing I got her um I went for the three month options. I just think they get more wear out of it maybe at 3 months and they do Newborn so um yeah I got her this week hard again and then I got this as well this dress um so this is for six months so say she's due in October. I think that leads us into April so November summer January. March April yep so potentially should be able to wear a dress around then and I just think it's cute and then the last thing I will know the last thing I got her in Ralph Lauren was this this top and it came with the matching leggings and I think it is so cute like. I absolutely love it to the point where I am debating keeping it for myself um for the daughter I may never have but um I love it and as I said. I don't like. I know she's not a fan of clothes with pictures and stuff on them um but I feel like this may be different. I don't know it just I love it um so I'm scared to give it to her in case she doesn't like appreciate it like I do because I just love it um so I'm thinking maybe I'll just keep it for myself and I got it in three months um honestly I feel like I probably will keep this set and then the last thing I got was this purple onesie from Baby Gap um I got it was pretty reduced. I can't remember how much it cost my receipt probably here somewhere but I thought it was cute the actual purple isn't showing up on the camera which is annoying it's a bit more bright purple than what showing up but yes I liked it was cute. I think everything I got was cute and I wish I was getting it for my own babies but I'm not so this will have to passify me for now and this is a long video so probably won't be watched all the way through or at all or whatever um but hopefully I'll get to making proper updates next month hopefully I'll get back at it 9 month after month um. Summer's over and I don't really have any financial commitments coming up because um I was. I was wondering how I was gonna do it um you know having to pay for my holiday and pay for traveling to a donor and all that stuff so yep next month um hopefully. I'll be back at it properly for the next few months if next month is my month um and probably I'll have to tell my work what I'm doing or my manager at least so that's that. I had a nice holiday. I hope everyone is doing well and. I hope we've had some positive pregnancy tests recently. I I don't know because I literally haven't logged on this like I have a another TikTok account which would be the one I would use on a daily basis and then I use this one when. I'm obsessing over getting pregnant so um. I'm gonna look for somebody else to see if anyone's had any luck and I really hope I see some positives okay bye also. I just wanted to add um so with the minute. I don't have an ovulation test. I order them from Amazon but I was staying at sort of like a remote location um and I've never had actually problems getting packages there before but um my ovulation test didn't arrive um so it's probably a sign anyway just to tell me to you know just enjoy myself and not focus on this stuff um but I did wanna track just in case I could make it back to Ireland on time to meet with my donor um but I'm pretty sure I'm ovulating today it's a warning the time I would be ovulating um. I don't know if I should just go into a shop and buy one. I don't know if I want to know. I don't know if that'll just upset me. I don't know if I just should just skip this month and you know go forward from here but I'm pretty sure it's today pretty sure anyway that's it okay bye

1,"Today I was invited to Lululemon for a special event, let instinct lead launch of Lululemon's fall women's casual collection and I had the absolute best time. Hi, I'm Jess, if you don't know me here, the fitness instructor and content creator living in New York City and I absolutely love Lululemon and Sonic Pink. Wow. But today's special event was all about fall. There were so many amazing pieces and you know,. I had to hit those fitting rooms. I loved this newly ribbed tee and this Marino wool blend cardigan. It was so incredibly soft and I loved the length. I also tried this cardigan and I didn't wanna take the straight leg pants off. They were so comfortable and they went with everything. And to this was the mixed woven short sleeve jacket in the color trench. This event was so much fun. They had mocktails that were delicious,. Martini and Rossi and the food was from Marlo and daughters. It was so fun being in Soho because it's New York Fashion Week and there was just so much energy on the streets, in the store, at the event. Can you guess what I walked away with?"
1,Let's go home from work and I pick something up. So let me show you what I got. You saw my try on a couple days ago. I did a try on of these 23in. Maldives green align leggings. Your tell me in the comments to get them. So here we are. Let me try them on for you. They are iconic. I am obsessed. Now I definitely not gonna wear these 2 colors together but like how cute. Just give me everything. And all these green. I am so obsessed. All these green. So beautiful. Go grab them.
1,"How's it going? Thought I would do a get ready with me, so yeah, get ready with me. These fantastic pants are from Uniqlo. They actually are on sale, so I might get another pair. Will see. But I love them. They are polyester, but this whole fit is pretty much gonna be polyester, so I guess I just have to suck it up. We've got this bad boy shirt from. I don't even know how to say the name, but it's actually from the 70s. So what happened was is, um, like a local vintage store had a bunch of new old stock from again, the 70s. Lot of polyester, which is fine. Very much a texture person, but this one was pretty soft, so it's got that massive collar. So excited to try it on. Has anyone been following the  Colleen  Ballinger stuff that's been going on? So the two things I've been following are the Robbie Harvey. You don't know who that is? Look him up. And then  Colleen  Ballinger. So the Robbie Harvey guy,. I actually followed him for a while. I don't know why,. I just did. Um, he had a lot of videos regarding the casting off kids and that whole case, and that's some wild shit. And obviously hope there's a positive resolution, but Catherine's passed on, so I don't know how positive, but for the kids sake office,. I hope it's okay. And then obviously with  Colleen  and Miranda sings again, someone That I followed, but I don't know if I fully understood the humor even back in the day. But I did follow her, so. So this shit is wild. Look at that. Look at that shirt. Look at that color. I love the plaque too. That's fantastic. I do have a tank top underneath just because I still prefer that, cause it does go kind of low, and I'm not about that life. Well, actually, I am. Maybe. Maybe I'm about that life. Not today, though. So this is the fit? Um, yeah. I'm quite happy with it. I'm throwing a gold watch because I just think the warm tones kind of giving. So that's what I'm gonna do. Thanks so much for watching. Have a great day and follow for more. I decided to throw it up in a pony. And let me tell you,. I almost forgot how to tie a ponytail. Don't ask how. I just did."
1,"Okay, let's do a quick, rapid fire outfit of the day. I'm wearing this Lululemon defined jacket. It's super flattering. It's tight, hugs you in all the right places. It goes in and then out a little bit. And then I'm wearing these crazy yoga. They're aligned dupes. They're Lululemon aligned dupes, and they're on Amazon. And they literally feel like the exact same thing as a Lululemon stand. I'm telling you, they feel the exact same thing. I love them. And they're like 30, and they're on Amazon. And then I have this Abercrombie crop tank. I love these tanks. They have the best basics. And then a flow y bra from Lululemon on underneath. And this is my outfit of the day. Oh, and these Nikes."
1,"Look what we got, guys, Shein haul! So this is one of my favorite dresses. I have this in blue, but I decided to buy it in purple. It's a very flattering look at the ruching. I bought the same dress in seafoam green and I also bought it in classic red. I got this two-piece which is giving me volleyball vibes. I got this cute rainbow number; you know how much I love a rainbow dress. You can make this shorter or longer; I think I'll keep it longer. I got this cute tie-dye dress which you can make shorter, make it up one side, have it like this, diagonal action, or you can have it long or you can have it wicked short. That's cute. Next up is this number, hello white party, it's good for the curves, except it's a little bit see-through. I have to figure this part out. I also got this denim number, now I know denim is not for everybody, but I think my husband, who's a little country bumpkin, will absolutely love and adore this one. So this is probably my 10th order from Shein, and for the first time, they done me wrong. So this is supposed to be a three-piece ombre bikini, and instead, I got something Christian Grey. In case you've never ordered from Shein for size reference, I'm 5'5, about 165 pounds, and everything I ordered was a large."
1,"This is what happens when you just start scrolling and you see something that you do not need. Cause I promise you what's in this package,. I don't need it. I have about 100 pairs of cargos and 100 pairs of mini crop tops, you know what I mean? But I saw it and I convinced myself I needed it. So let me just show you guys. I bought these because everyone had them. Everyone's, like, raving about them cause, you know, they're on TikTok shop. So I got these cause everyone had them, and I had to have them. Okay? I just wanted to be included. Um, I got this in a size 14, but, uh, very cute. Seems like really good quality, but, you know, pretty little thing. There's always good quality, to be honest. And to go with it,. I got this matching, like, white top because I don't know why I got it. I couldn't tell you why. Like, I have a lot of tops like this, but I just. I just wanted it. I saw her and I just let you know. Why not treat yourself? But, um, I got this in a size. Small eyes is really cute. Like, I didn't need it, but it's really cute. But one bad thing I will say, which is actually my fault, is I should have got a size 12, but, like, sometimes, like, I get size 12 and it's too small. But sometimes I get size 14 is too big. So I feel like I need it in between size. But I know they don't do in between sizes. Like the quality of these. 10 out of 10 and the top,. I won't lie to you. See, free. But like,. I don't care like it is what is. But um. Guys,. I'm actually in love and I wanna wear this right now cause I thought. Hello cute. Do you know what I mean?"
1,"Hey, guys, we have six Shein packages. I'm not sure why they're sending them like this, but it's kind of annoying. I think this might be all the stuff I ordered, but I'm not sure, so let's open them. This is a light to put on my phone when I'm filming. This is a stack of gold necklaces, and it has the letter J on it for my boyfriend's name. And then has a heart. We got some more sunglasses. These look like the other ones I ordered. Like, I think the same thing. So they must have sent me two of them by accident. So this is screen protector for my phone because mine is all cracked. Then I got new camera protectors because my gems fell off of mine. Phone case for my phone. And this is so cute. Last package,. I got this little tripod for filming, and it has a built in light on it. So it's not all of my stuff. I'm still missing a few things."
1,"I have a Shein haul. My countdown to Mexico is 2 days, so let's do this. I have no idea what I ordered, so. Surprise! Oh, my gosh. I could literally wear that right now. This is so cute. Such good fabric. Okay, next up. Okay, I'm a stand for little tube tops from Shein. They are so good. I think I ordered 2 of the same top. It's fine. I'll just give it to Tess. Okay. I think it came with, like, those little things to hang it up with. I've seen this on TikTok before. What a cute tube top. And now I have to. I feel like I can't make a shein order without getting a bathing suit. As you guys know,. I'm in, like, my lemon orange era. This is perfect. Sorry. I thought there was, like, a fly above me. You're joking. You're joking. Okay, this. I don't know why that is so small like that, but a little. And with some little bottoms. Look at how cute. And these ones are not that cheeky, which. Oh, maybe they are, but whatever. And they have, like, a little. Again, sticking on theme,. I got some, like, orange pajamas. I've never ordered pajamas from Shein, but I did want to try them out because I'm in my matching set era. Like, you're joking. You're joking. You're joking. I might have to order all those for all my friends because they're so cute. I've also seen this One on TikTok. So this is, like, soft. Okay. It's a little zebra. And shorts, which. Okay. I want to try to be able to sleep in shorts. I cannot sleep in shorts. I feel like it just makes me, like, so hot, and I just don't like that feeling. But I'm gonna try and. Okay, I know that I have a lot of lemon clips. I keep on find clips, and I don't even wear clips. But, you know, to prove it to myself,. I'm gonna wear them right now. Okay. I'm just gonna do, like, a little half up. Something like. Okay, see, I'm proving it to myself. Okay. Lastly,. I got a bunch of these little hoops. So cute. Okay, now I feel like I need to change my earrings into these little yellow hoops. Right. I'm taking out my iconic little dinosaurs. I love these dinosaurs. I get so many compliments on them. Everybody always ask where they're from. Bella got them for me, but they're from Francesca. Okay, let me put these in. These are so cute. I love, like, just, like, random little. Okay, why won't this going? Okay, that's adorable. But as I was saying, like, random little, like, color coordination. Like, yellow, yellow and yellow. Like,. I am living for it. Anyway, that's my Shein haul. I actually forgot, like, what kind of video I was making. Oh, I accidentally have 2 rings on. Okay. I don't know why I'm all over The place right now. Okay. Anyway, that was my Shein"
1,"Ready for the biggest shopping haul. I think I've ever done. I spent two days shopping in LA, so there's a lot to go through. Starting off with my favorite,. Love Shack fancy. You guys know they are the sweetest and wrap everything so pretty. I got this skirt that I'm gonna wear on Thanksgiving. Look it how adorable that is! They did a collab with Emi J, so I got one of her clip and two rolls of loveshack fancy wrapping paper to wrap all my gifts in that I'm giving my friends and family. Now moving on to Lululemon! I love their holiday bag! They had so much cute pink stuff and I kind of went crazy. First starting off,. I got this pink and gold fuzzy belt bag. I think this is the cutest thing. I did not know that they had a pink one! I don't know what this color is called, but I was obsessed with it. I decided to get it in a defined jacket. Adorable! And the same one in one of these little wristlet pouches. So cute! Also from Lululemon is. I got this really cute pink beanie that I'm definitely gonna wear when I go to New York. And then I surprisingly do not have a pair of Old Navy black leggings, so had to get a pair. Now moving on to Sephora! I think I lost my say bronzing drops, but that's okay because they had their limited edition and sunglow One. I mean starglow. This is such a good set. Next! You guys know I love love. Check. Fancy. So I got one of their mini perfumes. I'm hoping to get the big one of the pink bow one for Christmas, but I got the little one to try out next! I got the rare beauty under eye bright. They like never have this in the right shape. I was so happy to get it! I also they started their Black Friday sale. So I got one of their like jumbo sponges. I feel like that'll work amazing. The new Tower 28 moisturizer? Cause I'm. I'm almost out of my moisturizer so I'm really excited to try this guys! I literally audibly screamed when I found this. I've been looking for the Refine Brow sculpt for months and now I have it! Let's see if it's worth the hype from this random stand stand at the Grove! I got these really cute sunglasses. I posted a picture on Instagram in them. I love it! Moving on to Charlotte Tilbury! It makes me feel so fancy when they like package it like this. I really want to try out a new toner. So I got the glow toner. It is so pretty! I literally bought it because of the packaging and then I realized that it is actually really good. It has like a bunch of amazing stuff in it, so I'll let you guys know if I like. Okay! Next from Gap. I got one thing. These were on sale, and I thought that these would go perfectly with my new Love Shack skirt. Like these with this. And then I have this little white sweater. If I'm gonna have such cute Thanksgiving outfit, for some reason,. I feel like I'm always running out of white basic long sleeves. Is this anybody else? I don't really know, but I don't have a good one from Brandy, so I got this one. I love how it's full length, cause I feel like most of mine are all, like, cropped. Moving on to Nordstrom. I picked out a Christmas gift for myself, and then I got these pair of Christmas PJs. They're so soft. They're from the Nordstrom brand. It's like, the softest thing I've ever felt. Lastly, from Erewhon. I. You guys saw that I made a video trying a bunch of their stuff. So how was I supposed to leave without getting a cute little Erewhon tote bag? Like, are you kidding me? I could take this. Like, imagine me, like, in a farmer's market, you know? Like, it's so cute. Like, even with this outfit. Aha! Safe to say. I did some damage. Anyway, I love all the stuff that I got. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I love you guys."
